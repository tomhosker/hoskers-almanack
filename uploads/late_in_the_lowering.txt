from WINTER

Late in the lowering sky red fiery streaks
Begin to flush about; the reeling clouds
Stagger with dizzy aim, as doubting yet
Which master to obey: while rising, slow,
Sad, in the leaden-coloured east, the moon
Wears a black circle round her sullied Orb.
Then issues forth the storm, with loud control,
And the thin fabrick of the pillared air
O'erturns, at once. Prone, on th'uncertain main,
Descends th'ethereal force, and ploughs its waves,
With dreadful rift: from the mid-deep appears
Surge after surge, the rising watery war.
Whitening, the angry billows rowl immense,
And roar their rerrors, through the shuddering soul
Of feeble man, amidst their fury caught,
And dashed upon his fate: then, o'er the cliff,
Where dwells the sea-mew, unconfined, they fly,
And, hurrying, swallow up the sterile shore.

The mountain growls; and all its sturdy sons
Stoop to the bottom of the rocks they shade:
Lone on its midnight side, and all aghast,
The dark wayfaring stranger, breathless, toils
And climbs against the blast --
Low waves the rooted forest, vexed, and sheds
What of its leafy honours yet remains.
Thus, struggling through the dissipated grove,
The whirling tempest raves along the plain;
And, on the cottage thatched, or lordly dome,
Keen-fastening, shakes 'em to the solid base.
Sleep, frighted, flies; the hollow chimney howls,
The windows rattle, and the hinges creak.
