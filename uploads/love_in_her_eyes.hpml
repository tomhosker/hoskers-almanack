####REMARKS{Handel set these words to music in his operetta \textit{Acis and Galatea}.}

Love in her eyes sits playing,
##TAB And sheds delicious death;
Love on her lips is straying,
##TAB And warbling in her breath.
Love on her breast sits panting
##TAB And swells with soft desire;
No grace, no charm is wanting,
##TAB To set the heart on fire.
