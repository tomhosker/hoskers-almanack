####REMARKS{`Inscribed on a well, Derry Hill, near Chippenham, Wiltshire'. The middle couplet alludes to Matthew 6.3, and the final couplet to Matthew 10.42/Mark 9.41.}

Here quench your thirst, and mark in me
An emblem of true charity,
Who while my bounty I bestow
Am neither seen nor heard to flow;
Repaid by fresh supplies from heaven
For every cup of water given.
