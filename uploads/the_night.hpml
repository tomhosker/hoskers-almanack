The night is freezing fast;
##TAB Tomorrow comes december;
##TAB ##TAB And winterfalls of old
Are with me from the past;
##TAB And chiefly I remember
##TAB ##TAB How #PERSON{Dick} would hate the cold.

Fall, winter, fall; for he,
##TAB Prompt hand #ADD headpiece clever,
##TAB ##TAB Has woven a winter robe,
And made of earth #ADD sea
##TAB His overcoat for ever,
##TAB ##TAB And wears the turning globe.
