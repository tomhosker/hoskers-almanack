####TITLE{Sea Love}

Tide be runnin' the great world over:
##TAB 'Twas only last june month I mind that we
Was thinking the toss #ADD the call in the breast of the lover
##TAB So everlastin' as the sea.

Here's the same little fishes that sputter and swim,
##TAB Wi' the moon's old glim on the grey, wet sand;
An' him no more to me nor me to him
##TAB Than the wind goin' over my hand.
