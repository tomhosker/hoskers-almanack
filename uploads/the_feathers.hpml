The feathers of the willow
Are #HALF of them grown yellow
##TAB Above the swelling stream;
And ragged are the bushes,
And rusty now the rushes,
##TAB And wild the clouded gleam.

The thistle now is older;
His stalk begins to moulder;
##TAB His head is white as snow;
The branches all are barer;
The linnet's song is rarer;
##TAB The robin pipeth now.
