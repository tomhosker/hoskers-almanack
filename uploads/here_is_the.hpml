Here is the ancient floor,
##TAB Footworn #ADD hollowed #ADD thin,
Here was the former door
##TAB Where the dead feet walked in.

She sat here in her chair,
##TAB Smiling into the fire;
He who played stood there,
##TAB Bowing it higher #ADD higher.

Childlike, I danced in a dream;
##TAB Blessings emblazoned that day;
Everything glowed with a gleam;
##TAB Yet we were looking away.
