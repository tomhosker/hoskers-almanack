\poemlines{5}
When the green woods laugh, with the voice of joy\footnotetext{`Laughing Song', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
And the dimpling stream runs laughing by,\\
When the air does laugh with our merry wit,\\*
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it...\\!

When the meadows laugh with lively green,\\*
And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene;\\
When \emph{Mary} and \emph{Susan} and \emph{Emily}\\*
With their sweet round mouths sing, 'Ha ha he!'\\!

When the painted birds laugh in the shade\\*
Where our table with cherries \& nuts is spread:\\
Come live \& be merry and join with me\\*
To sing the sweet chorus of 'Ha ha he!'
\end{verse}
