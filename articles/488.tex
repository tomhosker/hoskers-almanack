Why, \emph{Damon}, with the forward day\footnotetext{`The Dying Man in His Garden', George Sewell (d. 1726). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
Dost thou thy little spot survey,\\
From tree to tree, with doubtful cheer,\\
Pursue the progress of the year,\\
What winds arise, what rains descend,\\*
When thou before that year shalt end?\\!

What do thy noontide walks avail,\\*
To clear the leaf, \& pick the snail,\\
Then wantonly to death decree\\
An insect usefuller than thee?\\
Thou \& the worm are brother-kind,\\*
As low, as earthy, \& as blind.\\!

Vain wretch! canst thou expect to see\\*
The downy peach make court to thee?\\
Or that thy sense shall ever meet\\
The bean-flower's deep-embosomed sweet\\
Exhaling with an evening blast?\\*
Thy evenings then will all be past!\\!

Thy narrow pride, thy fancied green\\*
(For vanity's in little seen),\\
All must be left when death appears,\\
In spite of wishes, groans, \& tears;\\
Nor one of all thy plants that grow\\*
But rosemary will with thee go.
\end{verse}
