\begin{verse}
\poemlines{5}
By the waters of {\sc Babylon} we sat down and wept\footnotetext{Psalm 137. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin When we remembered thee, O {\sc Zion}.\\
As for our harps, we hanged them up\\
\vin Upon the trees that are therein.\\
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our heaviness:\\*
\vin Sing us one of the songs of {\sc Zion}.\\!

How shall we sing the Lord's song\\*
\vin In a strange land?\\
If I forget thee, O {\sc Jerusalem},\\
\vin Let my right hand forget her cunning.\\
Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember thee;\footnotetext{11. The Almanackist has reversed the order of the clauses in this line.}\\*
\vin Yea, if I prefer not {\sc Jerusalem} in my mirth.\\!

Remember the children of Edom, O Lord,\\*
\vin In the day of{\sc Jerusalem},\\
How they said, Down with it, down with it,\\
\vin Even to the ground.\\
O daughter of {\sc Babylon}, wasted with misery,\\
\vin Yea, happy shall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.\\
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children\\*
\vin And dasheth them against the stones.\footnotetext{18. The \emph{BCP} gives `throweth' in this line, but the Almanackist prefers the KJV's `dasheth'.}
