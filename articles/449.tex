\poemlines{5}
And I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year,\footnotetext{`God Knows', Miss Minnie Haskins (1875 -- 1957). \cite{haskins}. The Almanackist has excised all but the first verse. George VI recited the first five lines of this poem in the Royal Christmas Message of 1939.}\\*
`Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.'\\
And he replied:\\
`Go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God.\\
That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way.'\\
So I went forth, and finding the hand of God, trod gladly into the night.\\*
And he led me towards the hills \& the breaking of day in the lone east.
