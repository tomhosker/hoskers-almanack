Give him the darkest inch your shelf allows,\footnotetext{`George Crabbe', Edwin Robinson (1869 -- 1935). \cite{norton}. Rev Mr George Crabbe was an English poet (and also a surgeon and, later, vicar) of the early nineteenth century.}\\*
\vin Hide him in lonely garrets, if you will,\\
\vin But his hard, human pulse is throbbing still\\
With the sure strength that fearless truth endows.\\
In spite of all fine science disavows,\\
\vin Of his plain excellence \& stubborn skill\\
\vin There yet remains what fashion cannot kill,\\*
Though years have thinned the laurel from his brows.\\!

Whether or not we read him, we can feel\\*
\vin From time to time the vigour of his name\\
\vin Against us like a finger for the shame\\
And emptiness of what our souls reveal\\
In books that are as altars where we kneel\\*
\vin To consecrate the flicker, not the flame.
