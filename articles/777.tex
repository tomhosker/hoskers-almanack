\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
You gentlemen of high renown, come listen unto me\footnotetext{L M Thornton (fl 1860). \cite{albion_band}.}\\*
That take delight in fox hunting by every degree.\\
A story now I'll tell to you concerning of a fox,\\*
O'er {\sc Royston} hills \& mountains high \& over stony rocks.\\!

\emph{Old Reynold} being in his den and hearing of these hounds,\\*
Which made him for to prick his ears and tread upon the ground.\\
`Methink me hear some jubal hounds pressing upon my life;\\*
Before that they do come to me I'll tread upon the ground.'\\!

We hunted full four hours or more by parishes 16.\\*
We hunted full four hours or more and came by {\sc Barkworth Green}.\\
`O if you'll only spare my life I'll promise and fulfil:\\*
I'll touch no more your feathered fowl nor lambs in yonder fold.'\\!

\emph{Old Reynold} beat and out of breath and dreading of these hounds,\\*
Thinking that he might lose his life before these jubal hounds:\\
`O here's adieu to duck \& geese, likewise young lamb also.'\\*
They've got \emph{Old Reynold} by the brush and will not let him go.\\!
