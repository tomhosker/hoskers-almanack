Thy voice is on the rolling air;\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin I hear thee where the waters run;\\
\vin Thou standest in the rising sun,\\*
And in the setting thou art fair.\\!

What art thou then? I cannot guess;\\*
\vin But though I seem in star \& flower\\
\vin To feel thee some diffusive power,\\*
I do not therefore love thee less.\\!

My love involves the love before;\\*
\vin My love is vaster passion now;\\
\vin Though mixed with God \& nature thou,\\*
I seem to love thee more \& more.\\!

Far off thou art, but ever nigh;\\*
\vin I have thee still, and I rejoice;\\
\vin I prosper, circled with thy voice;\\*
I shall not lose thee though I die.
