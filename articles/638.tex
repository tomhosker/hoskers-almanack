\poemlines{5}
Of the terrible doubt of appearances,\footnotetext{Walt Whitman (1819 -- 1892). \cite{ptmgmc}.}\\*
Of the uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded,\\
That maybe reliance \& hope are but speculations after all,\\
That maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,\\
Maybe the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills, shining \& flowing waters,\\
The skies of day \& night, colours, densities, forms, maybe these are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real something has yet to be known,\\
(How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me \& mock me!\\
How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of them)\\
Maybe seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) as from my present point of view, and might prove (as of course they would) nought of what they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely changed points of view;\\
To me these \& the like of these are curiously answered by my lovers, my dear friends,\\
When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me by the hand,\\
When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words \& reason hold not, surround us \& pervade us,\\ 
Then I am charged with untold \& untellable wisdom, I am silent; I require nothing further;\\
I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity beyond the grave,\\
But I walk or sit indifferent; I am satisfied;\\*
He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.
