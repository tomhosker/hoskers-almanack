I remember, I remember\footnotetext{Thomas Hood (1799 -- 1845). \cite{treasury}. Philip Larkin's own `I Remember, I Remember' is a sour response Hood's poem.}\\*
\vin The house where I was born,\\
The little window where the sun\\
\vin Came peeping in at morn;\\
He never came a wink too soon,\\
\vin Nor brought too long a day,\\
But now, I often wish the night\\*
\vin Had borne my breath away!\\!

I remember, I remember,\\*
\vin The roses, red \& white,\\
The violets, \& the lily-cups,\\
\vin Those flowers made of light!\\
The lilacs where the robin built,\\
\vin And where my brother set\\
The laburnum on his birthday --\\*
\vin The tree is living yet!\\!

I remember, I remember,\\*
\vin Where I was used to swing,\\
And thought the air must rush as fresh\\
\vin To swallows on the wing;\\
My spirit flew in feathers then,\\
\vin That is so heavy now,\\
And summer pools could hardly cool\\*
\vin The fever on my brow!\\!

I remember, I remember,\\*
\vin The fir trees dark \& high;\\
I used to think their slender tops\\
\vin Were close against the sky:\\
It was a childish ignorance,\\
\vin But now 'tis little joy\\
To know I'm farther off from heav'n\\*
\vin Than when I was a boy.
