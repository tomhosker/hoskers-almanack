Taller today, we remember similar evenings, evenings,\footnotetext{`Taller Today', Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
Walking together in the windless orchard\\*
Where the brook runs over the gravel, far from the glacier.\\!

Again in the room with the sofa hiding the grate,\\*
Look down to the river when the rain is over,\\
See him turn to the window, hearing our last\\*
Of Captain \emph{Ferguson}.\\!

It is seen how excellent hands have turned to commonness.\\*
One staring too long, went blind in a tower,\\*
One sold all his manors to fight, broke through, and faltered.\\!

Nights come bringing the snow, and the dead howl\\*
Under the headlands in their windy dwelling\\
Because the Adversary put too easy questions\\*
On lonely roads\\!

But happy now, though no nearer each other,\\*
We see the farms lighted all along the valley;\\
Down at the mill-shed the hammering stops\\*
And men go home.\\!

Noises at dawn will bring\\*
Freedom for some, but not this peace\\
No bird can contradict: passing, but is sufficient now\\*
For something fulfilled this hour, loved or endured.
\end{verse}
