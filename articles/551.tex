She wore a new terracotta dress,\footnotetext{`A Thunderstorm in Town', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{newlove}. Hardy's subtitle indicates that the poem is based on a memory of his from 1893.}\\*
And we stayed, because of the pelting storm,\\
Within the hansom's dry recess,\\
Though the horse had stopped; yea, motionless\\*
\vin We sat on, snug \& warm.\\!

Then the downpour ceased, to my sharp sad pain\\*
And the glass that had screened our forms before\\
Flew up, and out she sprang to her door:\\
I should have kissed her if the rain\\*
\vin Had lasted a minute moor.
