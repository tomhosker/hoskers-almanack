\poemlines{5}
\vin In the age of gold,\footnotetext{`A Little Girl Lost', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
\vin Free from winter's cold,\\
\vin Youth and maiden bright,\\
\vin To the holy light,\\*
Naked in the sunny beams delight.\\!

\vin Once a youthful pair,\\*
\vin Filled with softest care,\\
\vin Met in garden bright\\
\vin Where the holy light\\*
Had just removed the curtains of the night.\\!

\vin There, in rising day,\\*
\vin On the grass they play;\\
\vin Parents were afar;\\
\vin Strangers came not near,\\*
And the maiden soon forgot her fear.\\!

\vin Tired with kisses sweet,\\*
\vin They agree to meet\\
\vin When the silent sleep\\
\vin Waves o'er heaven's deep,\\*
And the weary tired wanderers weep.\\!

\vin To her father white\\*
\vin Came the maiden bright;\\
\vin But his loving look,\\
\vin Like the holy book,\\*
All her tender limbs with terror shook.\\!

\vin \emph{Ona}, pale and weak,\\*
\vin To thy father speak.\\
\vin O the trembling fear!\\
\vin O the dismal care\\*
That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!
