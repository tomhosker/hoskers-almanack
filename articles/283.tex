\poemlines{5}
I called my servant, and he gave me no answer;\footnotetext{Job 19.2-29. \cite{kjv}.}\\*
\vin I entreated him with my mouth.\\
My breath is strange to my wife,\\
\vin Though I entreated for the children's sake of mine own body.\\
Yea, young children despised me;\\
\vin I arose, \& they spake against me.\\
All my inward friends abhorred me:\\
\vin And they whom I loved are turned against me.\\
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,\\
\vin And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.\\
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;\\*
\vin For the hand of God hath touched me.\\!

Why do ye persecute me as God,\\*
\vin And are not satisfied with my flesh?\\
O that my words were now written!\\
\vin O that they were printed in a book!\\
That they were graven with an iron pen \& lead\\
\vin In the rock for ever!\\
For I know that my redeemer liveth,\\
\vin And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:\\
And though after my skin worms destroy this body,\\
\vin Yet in my flesh shall I see God:\\
Whom I shall see for myself,\\
\vin And mine eyes shall behold, and not another;\\*
\vin Though my reins be consumed within me.\\!

But ye should say, `Why persecute we him,\\*
\vin Seeing the root of the matter is found in me?'\\
Be ye afraid of the sword:\\
\vin For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword,\\*
\vin That ye may know there is a judgment.
