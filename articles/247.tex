By night we lingered on the lawn,\footnotetext{From \emph{In Memoriam A. H. H.} \S 95, Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\*
For underfoot the herb was dry;\\
And genial warmth; and o'er the sky\\*
The silvery haze of summer drawn;\\!

And calm that let the tapers burn\\*
Unwavering: not a cricket chirred:\\
The brook alone far-off was heard,\\*
And on the board the fluttering urn:\\!

And bats went round in fragrant skies,\\*
And wheeled or lit the filmy shapes\\
That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes\\*
And woolly breasts and beaded eyes;\\!

While now we sang old songs that pealed\\*
From knoll to knoll, where, couched at ease,\\ 
The white kine glimmered, and the trees\\*
Laid their dark arms about the field.\\!

But when those others, one by one,\\*
Withdrew themselves from me and night,\\
And in the house light after light\\*
Went out, and I was all alone,\\!

A hunger seized my heart; I read\\*
Of that glad year which once had been,\\
In those fall'n leaves which kept their green,\\*
The noble letters of the dead:\\!

And strangely on the silence broke\\*
The silent-speaking words, and strange\\
Was love's dumb cry defying change\\*
To test his worth; and strangely spoke\\!

The faith, the vigour, bold to dwell\\*
On doubts that drive the coward back,\\
And keen through wordy snares to track\\*
Suggestion to her inmost cell.\\!

So word by word, and line by line,\\*
The dead man touched me from the past,\\ 
And all at once it seemed at last\\* 
The living soul was flashed on mine,\\!

And mine in this was wound, and whirled\\*
About empyreal heights of thought,\\
And came on that which is, and caught\\* 
The deep pulsations of the world,\\!

Aeonian music measuring out\\*
The steps of time, the shocks of chance,\\
The blows of death. At length my trance\\*
Was cancelled, stricken through with doubt.\\!

Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame\\*
In matter-moulded forms of speech,\\
Or ev'n for intellect to reach\\*
Through memory that which I became:\\!

Till now the doubtful dusk revealed\\*
The knolls once more where, couched at ease,\\ 
The white kine glimmered, and the trees\\*
Laid their dark arms about the field:\\!

And sucked from out the distant gloom\\*
A breeze began to tremble o'er\\
The large leaves of the sycamore,\\*
And fluctuate all the still perfume,\\!

And gathering freshlier overhead,\\*
Rocked the full-foliaged elms, and swung\\
The heavy-folded rose, and flung\\*
The lilies to \& fro, and said,\\!

`The dawn, the dawn,' and died away;\\* 
And east and west, without a breath,\\
Mixt their dim lights, like life and death,\\*
To broaden into boundless day.\\!
