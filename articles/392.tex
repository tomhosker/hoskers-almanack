Ah what avails the sceptred race,\footnotetext{`Rose Aylmer', Walter Landor (1775 -- 1864). \cite{norton}. Landor was inspired to write these verses by the Hon Rose Aylmer, daughter of the fourth Baron Aylmer; she is an obscure character, who appears to have died in 1800.}\\*
\vin Ah what the form divine!\\
What every virtue, every grace!\\
\vin \emph{Rose Aylmer}, all were thine.\\
\emph{Rose Aylmer}, whom these wakeful eyes\\
\vin May weep, but never see,\\
A night of memories \& of sighs\\*
\vin I consecrate to thee.
