\poemlines{5}
All such proclivities are tabulated\footnotetext{`The Quiet Glades of Eden', Prof Robert Graves (1895 -- 1985). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
By trained pathologists -- in detail too --\\
The obscener parts of speech compulsively\\*
\vin Shrouded in classic latin.\\!

But though my pleasure in your feet \& hair\\*
Is ungainsayable, let me protest\\
(Dear love) I am no trichomaniac\\*
\vin And no foot-fetichist.\\!

If it should please you, for your own best reasons,\\*
To take \& flog me with a rawhide whip,\\
I might (who knows?) suprisedly accept\\*
\vin This earnest of affection.\\!

Nothing, agreed, is alien to love\\*
When pure desire has overflowed its baulks;\\
But why must private sportiveness be viewed\\*
\vin Through public spectacles?\\!

Enough, I will not claim a heart unfluttered\\*
By these case-histories of aberrancy;\\
Nevertheless a long cool draught of water,\\*
\vin Or a long swim in the bay,\\!

Serves to restore my wholesome appetite\\*
For you \& what we do at night together:\\
Which is no more than \emph{Adam} did with \emph{Eve}\\*
\vin In the quiet glades of Eden.
