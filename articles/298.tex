\poemlines{5}
Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks,\footnotetext{Psalm 42. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin So longeth my soul after thee, O God.\\
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God;\\
\vin When shall I come to appear before the presence of God?\\
My tears have been my meat day \& night,\\*
\vin While they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God?\\!

Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself,\\*
\vin For I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;\\
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving,\\
\vin Among such as keep holy-day.\\
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul\\
\vin And why art thou so disquieted within me?\\
Put thy trust in God,\\*
\vin For I will yet give him thanks for the help of his countenance.\\!

My God, my soul is vexed within me,\\*
\vin Therefore will I remember thee concerning the land of {\sc Jordan}, and the little hill of {\sc Hermon}.\\
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes,\\
\vin All thy waves \& storms are gone over me.\\
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time,\\*
\vin And in the night-season did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.\\!

I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me?\\*
\vin Why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\\
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword,\\
\vin While mine enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;\\
Namely, while they say daily unto me,\\
\vin Where is now thy God?\\
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul?\\
\vin And why art thou so disquieted within me?\\
O put thy trust in God,\\*
\vin For I will yet thank him, which is the help of my countenance, and my God.\\
