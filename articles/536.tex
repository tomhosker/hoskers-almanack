Father, father, where are you going?\footnotetext{`The Little Boy Lost' \& `The Little Boy Found', William Blake (1881 -- 1968). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
\vin O do not walk so fast.\\
Speak father; speak to your little boy\\*
\vin Or else I shall be lost.\\!

The night was dark; no father was there;\\*
\vin The child was wet with dew.\\
The mire was deep, \& the child did weep\\*
\vin And away the vapour flew.\\!

The little boy lost in the lonely fen,\\*
\vin Led by the wand'ring light,\\
Began to cry, but God ever nigh,\\*
\vin Appeared like his father in white.\\!

He kissed the child and by the hand led\\*
\vin And to his mother brought,\\
Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale\\*
\vin Her little weeping boy sought.
