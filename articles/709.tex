We kissed at the barrier; and passing through\footnotetext{`On the Departure Platform', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\* 
She left me, and moment by moment got\\
Smaller \& smaller, until to my view\\*
\vin She was but a spot;\\!

A wee white spot of muslin fluff\\*
That down the diminishing platform bore\\
Through hustling crowds of gentle \& rough\\*
\vin To the carriage door.\\!

Under the lamplight's fitful glowers,\\*
Behind dark groups from far \& near,\\
Whose interests were apart from ours,\\*
\vin She would disappear,\\!

Then show again, till I ceased to see\\*
That flexible form, that nebulous white;\\
And she who was more than my life to me\\*
\vin Had vanished quite.\\!

We have penned new plans since that fair fond day,\\*
And in season she will appear again\\
-- Perhaps in the same soft white array --\\*
\vin But never as then.\\!

`And why, young man, must eternally fly\\*
A joy you'll repeat, if you love her well?'\\
O friend, nought happens twice thus; why,\\*
\vin I cannot tell.
