\flagverse{\footnotesize Part I} It is an ancient mariner\footnotetext{`The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', Samuel Coleridge (1772 -- 1834). \cite{norton}. Coleridge kicks off his `Rime' with a lengthy quotation from a seventeenth century theologian, Thomas Burnet, and the original text is peppered with margin-notes throughout.}\\*
\vin And he stoppeth one of three.\\
`By thy long grey beard \& glittering eye,\\*
\vin Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?\\!

`The bridegroom's doors are opened wide,\\*
\vin And I am next of kin;\\
The guests are met; the feast is set:\\*
\vin May'st hear the merry din.'\\!

He holds him with his skinny hand,\\*
\vin 'There was a ship,' quoth he.\\
'Hold off! Unhand me, grey-beard loon!'\\*
\vin Eftsoons his hand dropped he.\\!

He holds him with his glittering eye --\\*
\vin The wedding-guest stood still,\\
And listens like a three years' child:\\*
\vin The mariner hath his will.\\!

The wedding-guest sat on a stone:\\*
\vin He cannot choose but hear;\\
And thus spake on that ancient man,\\
\vin The bright-eyed mariner.\\!

`The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,\\*
\vin Merrily did we drop\\
Below the kirk, below the hill,\\*
\vin Below the lighthouse-top.\\!

`The sun came up upon the left,\\*
\vin Out of the sea came he.\\
And he shone bright, and on the right\\*
\vin Went down into the sea.\\!

`Higher \& higher every day,\\*
\vin Till over the mast at noon --'\\
The wedding-guest here beat his breast,\\
\vin For he heard the loud bassoon.\\!

`The bride hath paced into the hall,\\*
\vin Red as a rose is she;\\
Nodding their heads before her goes\\*
\vin The merry minstrelsy.\\!

`The wedding-guest he beat his breast,\\*
\vin Yet he cannot choose but hear;\\
And thus spake on that ancient man,\\*
\vin The bright-eyed mariner.\\!

`And now the storm-blast came, and he\\*
\vin Was tyrannous \& strong:\\
He struck with his o'ertaking wings,\\*
\vin And chased us south along.\\!

`With sloping masts \& dipping prow,\\*
As who pursued with yell \& blow\\
Still treads the shadow of his foe,\\
\vin And forward bends his head,\\
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,\\*
\vin And southward aye we fled.\\!

`And now there came both mist \& snow,\\*
\vin And it grew wondrous cold:\\
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,\\*
\vin As green as emerald.\\!

`And through the drifts the snowy clifts\\*
\vin Did send a dismal sheen:\\
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken --\\*
\vin The ice was all between.\\!

`The ice was here; the ice was there;\\*
\vin The ice was all around:\\
It cracked \& growled, and roared \& howled,\\*
\vin Like noises in a swound!\\!

`At length did cross an albatross,\\*
\vin Thorough the fog it came;\\
As if it had been a christian soul,\\*
\vin We hailed it in God's name.\\!

`It ate the food it ne'er had eat,\\*
\vin And round \& round it flew.\\
The ice did split with a thunder-fit;\\*
\vin The helmsman steered us through.\\

`And a good south wind sprung up behind;\\*
\vin The albatross did follow,\\
And every day, for food or play,\\*
\vin Came to the mariner's hollo!\\!

`In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,\\*
\vin It perched for vespers nine;\\
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,\\*
\vin Glimmered the white Moon-shine.'\\!

'God save thee, ancient Mariner!\\*
\vin From the fiends, that plague thee thus!\\
Why look'st thou so?' `With my cross-bow\\*
\vin I shot the albatross.\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part II} `The sun now rose upon the right:\\*
\vin Out of the sea came he,\\
Still hid in mist, and on the left\\*
\vin Went down into the sea.\\!

`And the good south wind still blew behind,\\*
\vin But no sweet bird did follow,\\
Nor any day for food or play\\*
\vin Came to the mariner's hollo.\\!

`And I had done a hellish thing,\\*
\vin And it would work 'em woe:\\
For all averred, I had killed the bird\\
\vin hat made the breeze to blow.\\
``Ah wretch!'' said they, ``The bird to slay,\\*
\vin That made the breeze to blow!''\\!

`Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,\\*
\vin The glorious sun uprist:\\
Then all averred, I had killed the bird\\
\vin That brought the fog and mist.\\
``'Twas right,'' said they, ``Such birds to slay,\\*
\vin That bring the fog \& mist.''\\!

`The fair breeze blew; the white foam flew;\\*
\vin The furrow followed free;\\
We were the first that ever burst\\*
\vin Into that silent sea.\\!

`Down dropped the breeze, the sails dropt down;\\*
\vin 'Twas sad as sad could be;\\
And we did speak only to break\\*
\vin The silence of the sea!\\!

`All in a hot \& copper sky,\\*
\vin The bloody sun, at noon,\\
Right up above the mast did stand,\\*
\vin No bigger than the moon.\\!

`Day after day, day after day,\\*
\vin We stuck, nor breath nor motion;\\
As idle as a painted ship\\*
\vin Upon a painted ocean.\\!

`Water, water, every where,\\*
\vin And all the boards did shrink;\\
Water, water, every where,\\*
\vin Nor any drop to drink.\\!

`The very deep did rot: O \emph{Christ}!\\*
\vin That ever this should be!\\
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs\\*
\vin Upon the slimy sea.\\!

`About, about, in reel \& rout\\*
\vin The death-fires danced at night;\\ 
The water, like a witch's oils,\\*
\vin Burnt green, and blue \& white.\\!

`And some in dreams assur\`ed were\\*
\vin Of the spirit that plagued us so;\\
Nine fathom deep he had followed us\\*
\vin From the land of mist \& snow.\\!

`And every tongue, through utter drought,\\*
\vin Was withered at the root;\\
We could not speak, no more than if\\*
\vin We had been choked with soot.\\!

`Ah well a-day what evil looks\\*
\vin Had I from old \& young!\\
Instead of the cross, the albatross\\*
\vin About my neck was hung.\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part III} `There passed a weary time. Each throat\\*
\vin Was parched, and glazed each eye.\\
A weary time! a weary time!\\
\vin How glazed each weary eye,\\
When looking westward, I beheld\\*
\vin A something in the sky.\\!

`At first it seemed a little speck,\\*
\vin And then it seemed a mist;\\
It moved \& moved, and took at last\\*
\vin A certain shape, I wist.\\!

`A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!\\*
\vin And still it neared \& neared:\\
As if it dodged a water-sprite,\\*
\vin It plunged \& tacked \& veered.\\!

`With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\\*
\vin We could nor laugh nor wail;\\
Through utter drought all dumb we stood.\\
I bit my arm; I sucked the blood,\\*
\vin And cried, ``A sail! A sail!''\\!

`With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\\*
\vin Agape they heard me call:\\
``Gramercy!'' they for joy did grin,\\
And all at once their breath drew in.\\*
\vin As they were drinking all.\\!

`{``}See! See!'' I cried. ``She tacks no more\\*
\vin Hither to work us weal;\\
Without a breeze, without a tide,\\*
\vin She steadies with upright keel!''\\!

`The western wave was all aflame.\\*
\vin The day was well nigh done.\\
Almost upon the western wave\\
\vin Rested the broad bright sun;\\
When that strange shape drove suddenly\\*
\vin Betwixt us and the sun.\\!

`And straight the sun was flecked with bars,\\*
\vin (Heaven's mother send us grace!)\\
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered\\*
\vin With broad \& burning face.\\!

`{``}Alas!'' thought I, and my heart beat loud,\\*
\vin ``How fast she nears \& nears!\\
Are those her sails that glance in the sun,\\*
\vin Like restless gossameres?\\!

`{``}Are those her ribs through which the sun\\*
\vin Did peer, as through a grate?\\
And is that woman all her crew?\\
Is that a death? and are there two?\\*
\vin Is death that woman's mate?''\\!

`Her lips were red; her looks were free;\\*
\vin Her locks were yellow as gold:\\
Her skin was as white as leprosy;\\
The nightmare life-in-death was she,\\* 
\vin Who thicks man's blood with cold.\\!

`The naked hulk alongside came,\\*
\vin And the twain were casting dice;\\
``The game is done! I've won! I've won!''\\*
\vin Quoth she, and whistles thrice.\\!

`The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;\\*
\vin At one stride comes the dark;\\
With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,\\*
\vin Off shot the spectre-bark.\\!

`We listened \& looked sideways up!\\*
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,\\
\vin My life-blood seemed to sip!\\
The stars were dim, and thick the night,\\
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;\\
\vin From the sails the dew did drip --\\
Till clomb above the eastern bar\\
The horn\`ed moon, with one bright star\\*
\vin Within the nether tip.\\!

`One after one, by the star-dogged moon,\\*
\vin Too quick for groan or sigh,\\
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,\\*
\vin And cursed me with his eye.\\!

`Four times 50 living men,\\* 
\vin (And I heard nor sigh nor groan)\\
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,\\*
\vin They dropped down one by one.\\!

`The souls did from their bodies fly --\\*
\vin They fled to bliss or woe!\\
And every soul, it passed me by,\\*
\vin Like the whizz of my cross-bow!'\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part IV}`I fear thee, ancient mariner!\\*
\vin I fear thy skinny hand!\\
And thou art long, \& lank, \& brown,\\*
\vin As is the ribbed sea-sand.\\!

`I fear thee and thy glittering eye,\\*
\vin And thy skinny hand, so brown.'\\
`Fear not, fear not, thou wedding-guest!\\*
\vin This body dropped not down.\\!

`Alone, alone, all, all alone,\\*
\vin Alone on a wide wide sea!\\
And never a saint took pity on\\*
\vin My soul in agony.\\!

`The many men, so beautiful!\\*
\vin And they all dead did lie:\\
And a 1000 1000 slimy things\\*
\vin Lived on; and so did I.\\!

`I looked upon the rotting sea,\\*
\vin And drew my eyes away;\\
I looked upon the rotting deck,\\*
\vin And there the dead men lay.\\!

`I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;\\*
\vin But or ever a prayer had gushed,\\
A wicked whisper came, and made\\*
\vin My heart as dry as dust.\\!

`I closed my lids, and kept them close,\\*
\vin And the balls like pulses beat;\\
For the sky \& the sea, and the sea \& the sky\\
Lay dead like a load on my weary eye,\\*
\vin And the dead were at my feet.\\!

`The cold sweat melted from their limbs,\\*
\vin Nor rot nor reek did they:\\
The look with which they looked on me\\*
\vin Had never passed away.\\!

`An orphan's curse would drag to hell\\*
\vin A spirit from on high;\\
But O more horrible than that\\
\vin Is the curse in a dead man's eye!\\
Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,\\*
\vin And yet I could not die.\\!

`The moving moon went up the sky,\\*
\vin And no where did abide:\\
Softly she was going up,\\*
\vin And a star or two beside --\\!

`Her beams bemocked the sultry main,\\*
\vin Like april hoar-frost spread;\\
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,\\
The charm\`ed water burnt alway\\*
\vin A still \& awful red.\\!

`Beyond the shadow of the ship,\\*
\vin I watched the water-snakes:\\
They moved in tracks of shining white,\\
And when they reared, the elfish light\\*
\vin Fell off in hoary flakes.\\!

`Within the shadow of the ship\\*
\vin I watched their rich attire:\\
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,\\
They coiled \& swam; and every track\\*
\vin Was a flash of golden fire.\\!

`O happy living things, no tongue\\*
\vin Their beauty might declare:\\
A spring of love gushed from my heart,\\
\vin And I blessed them unaware:\\
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,\\*
\vin And I blessed them unaware.\\!

`The selfsame moment I could pray;\\*
\vin And from my neck so free\\
The albatross fell off, and sank\\* 
\vin Like lead into the sea.\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part V}`O sleep, it is a gentle thing,\\*
\vin Beloved from pole to pole!\\
To \emph{Mary} Queen the praise be given!\\
She sent the gentle sleep from heaven,\\*
\vin That slid into my soul.\\!

`The silly buckets on the deck,\\*
\vin That had so long remained,\\
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;\\*
\vin And when I awoke, it rained.\\!

`My lips were wet; my throat was cold;\\*
\vin My garments all were dank;\\
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,\\*
\vin And still my body drank.\\!

`I moved, and could not feel my limbs:\\*
\vin I was so light -- almost\\
I thought that I had died in sleep,\\*
\vin And was a bless\`ed ghost.\\!

`And soon I heard a roaring wind:\\*
\vin It did not come anear;\\
But with its sound it shook the sails,\\*
\vin That were so thin \& sere.\\!

`The upper air burst into life!\\*
\vin And a 100 fire-flags sheen,\\
To \& fro they were hurried about!\\
And to \& fro, and in \& out,\\*
\vin The wan stars danced between.\\!

`And the coming wind did roar more loud,\\*
\vin And the sails did sigh like sedge,\\
And the rain poured down from one black cloud;\\*
\vin The moon was at its edge.\\!

`The thick black cloud was cleft, and still\\*
\vin The moon was at its side:\\
Like waters shot from some high crag,\\
The lightning fell with never a jag,\\*
\vin A river steep \& wide.\\!

`The loud wind never reached the ship,\\*
\vin Yet now the ship moved on!\\
Beneath the lightning and the moon\\*
\vin The dead men gave a groan.\\!

`They groaned; they stirred; they all uprose,\\*
\vin Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;\\
It had been strange, even in a dream,\\*
\vin To have seen those dead men rise.\\!

`The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;\\*
\vin Yet never a breeze up-blew;\\
The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,\\
\vin Where they were wont to do;\\
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools --\\*
\vin We were a ghastly crew.\\!

`The body of my brother's son\\*
\vin Stood by me, knee to knee:\\
The body \& I pulled at one rope,\\* 
\vin But he said nought to me.'\\!

`I fear thee, ancient mariner!'\\* 
\vin `Be calm, thou wedding-guest!\\
'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,\\
Which to their corses came again,\\*
\vin But a troop of spirits blest:\\!

`For when it dawned -- they dropped their arms,\\*
\vin And clustered round the mast;\\
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,\\*
\vin And from their bodies passed.\\!

`Around, around, flew each sweet sound,\\*
\vin Then darted to the sun;\\
Slowly the sounds came back again,\\*
\vin Now mixed, now one by one.\\!

`Sometimes a-dropping from the sky\\*
\vin I heard the sky-lark sing;\\
Sometimes all little birds that are,\\
How they seemed to fill the sea and air\\*
\vin With their sweet jargoning!\\!

`And now 'twas like all instruments,\\*
\vin Now like a lonely flute;\\
And now it is an angel's song,\\*
\vin That makes the heavens be mute.\\!

`It ceased; yet still the sails made on\\*
\vin A pleasant noise till noon,\\
A noise like of a hidden brook\\
\vin In the leafy month of june,\\
That to the sleeping woods all night\\*
\vin Singeth a quiet tune.\\!

`Till noon we quietly sailed on,\\*
\vin Yet never a breeze did breathe:\\
Slowly \& smoothly went the ship,\\*
\vin Moved onward from beneath.\\!

`Under the keel nine fathom deep,\\*
\vin From the land of mist \& snow,\\
The spirit slid: and it was he\\
\vin That made the ship to go.\\
The sails at noon left off their tune,\\*
\vin And the ship stood still also.\\!

`The sun, right up above the mast,\\*
\vin Had fixed her to the ocean:\\
But in a minute she 'gan stir,\\
\vin With a short uneasy motion --\\
Backwards \& forwards \sfrac{1}{2} her length\\* 
\vin With a short uneasy motion.\\!

`Then like a pawing horse let go,\\*
\vin She made a sudden bound:\\
It flung the blood into my head,\\*
\vin And I fell down in a swound.\\!

`How long in that same fit I lay,\\*
\vin I have not to declare;\\
But ere my living life returned,\\
I heard and in my soul discerned\\*
\vin Two voices in the air.\\!

`{``}Is it he?'' quoth one, ``Is this the man?\\*
\vin By him who died on cross,\\
With his cruel bow he laid full low\\*
\vin The harmless albatross.\\!

`{``}The spirit who bideth by himself\\*
\vin In the land of mist \& snow,\\
He loved the bird that loved the man\\*
\vin Who shot him with his bow.''\\!

`The other was a softer voice,\\*
\vin As soft as honey-dew:\\
Quoth he, ``The man hath penance done,\\*
\vin And penance more will do.''

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part VI}`{``}But tell me! Tell me! Speak again,\\*
\flagverse{\footnotesize First Voice}\vin Thy soft response renewing --\\
What makes that ship drive on so fast?\\*
\vin What is the ocean doing?''\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Second Voice}`{``}Still as a slave before his lord,\\*
\vin The ocean hath no blast;\\
His great bright eye most silently\\*
\vin Up to the moon is cast --\\!

`{``}If he may know which way to go;\\*
\vin For she guides him smooth or grim.\\
See, brother, see! how graciously\\*
\vin She looketh down on him.''\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize First Voice}`{``}But why drives on that ship so fast,\\*
\vin Without or wave or wind?''\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Second Voice}`{``}The air is cut away before,\\*
\vin And closes from behind.\\!

`{``}Fly, brother, fly! More high, more high!\\*
\vin Or we shall be belated:\\
For slow \& slow that ship will go,\\*
\vin When the mariner's trance is abated.''\\! 

`I woke, and we were sailing on\\*
\vin As in a gentle weather:\\
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;\\*
\vin The dead men stood together.\\!

`All stood together on the deck,\\*
\vin For a charnel-dungeon fitter:\\
All fixed on me their stony eyes,\\*
\vin That in the moon did glitter.\\!

`The pang, the curse, with which they died,\\*
\vin Had never passed away:\\
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,\\*
\vin Nor turn them up to pray.\\!

`And now this spell was snapped: once more\\*
\vin I viewed the ocean green,\\
And looked far forth, yet little saw\\*
\vin Of what had else been seen --\\!

`Like one, that on a lonesome road\\*
\vin Doth walk in fear \& dread,\\
And having once turned round walks on,\\
\vin And turns no more his head;\\
Because he knows, a frightful fiend\\*
\vin Doth close behind him tread.\\!

`But soon there breathed a wind on me,\\*
\vin Nor sound nor motion made:\\
Its path was not upon the sea,\\*
\vin In ripple or in shade.\\!

`It raised my hair; it fanned my cheek\\*
\vin Like a meadow-gale of spring --\\
It mingled strangely with my fears,\\*
\vin Yet it felt like a welcoming.\\!

`Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,\\*
\vin Yet she sailed softly too:\\
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze --\\*
\vin On me alone it blew.\\!

`O dream of joy, is this indeed\\* 
\vin The light-house top I see?\\
Is this the hill? Is this the kirk?\\* 
\vin Is this mine own country?\\!

`We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\\*
\vin And I with sobs did pray --\\
``O let me be awake, my God!\\*
\vin Or let me sleep alway.''\\!

`The harbour-bay was clear as glass,\\*
\vin So smoothly it was strewn.\\
And on the bay the moonlight lay,\\*
\vin And the shadow of the moon.\\!

`The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,\\*
\vin That stands above the rock:\\
The moonlight steeped in silentness\\*
\vin The steady weathercock.\\!

`And the bay was white with silent light,\\*
\vin Till rising from the same,\\
Full many shapes, that shadows were,\\*
\vin In crimson colours came.\\!

`A little distance from the prow\\*
\vin Those crimson shadows were:\\
I turned my eyes upon the deck --\\*
\vin O \emph{Christ}! What saw I there!\\!

`Each corse lay flat, lifeless \& flat,\\*
\vin And, by the holy rood!\\
A man all light, a seraph-man,\\*
\vin On every corse there stood.\\!

`This seraph-band, each waved his hand:\\*
\vin It was a heavenly sight!\\*
They stood as signals to the land,\\*
\vin Each one a lovely light;\\!

`This seraph-band, each waved his hand,\\*
\vin No voice did they impart --\\
No voice; but O the silence sank\\*
\vin Like music on my heart.\\!

`But soon I heard the dash of oars,\\*
\vin I heard the pilot's cheer;\\
My head was turned perforce away\\*
\vin And I saw a boat appear.\\!

`The pilot \& the pilot's boy,\\*
\vin I heard them coming fast:\\
Dear Lord in Hhaven! it was a joy\\*
\vin The dead men could not blast.\\!

`I saw a third -- I heard his voice:\\*
\vin It is the hermit good!\\
He singeth loud his godly hymns\\
\vin That he makes in the wood.\\
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away\\*
\vin The albatross's blood.\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize Part VII}`This hermit good lives in that wood\\*
\vin Which slopes down to the sea.\\
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!\\
He loves to talk with marineres\\*
\vin That come from a far country.\\!

`He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve --\\*
\vin He hath a cushion plump:\\
It is the moss that wholly hides\\*
\vin The rotted old oak-stump.\\!

`The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,\\*
\vin ``Why, this is strange, I trow!\\
Where are those lights so many \& fair,\\*
\vin That signal made but now?''\\!

`{``}Strange, by my faith!'' the hermit said,\\*
\vin ``And they answered not our cheer!\\
The planks looked warped! And see those sails,\\
\vin How thin they are \& sere!\\
I never saw aught like to them,\\*
\vin Unless perchance it were\\!

`{``}Brown skeletons of leaves that lag\\*
\vin My forest-brook along;\\
When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,\\
And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,\\*
\vin That eats the she-wolf's young.''\\!

`{``}Dear Lord, it hath a fiendish look --''\\*
\vin The pilot made reply,\\
``I am afeared.'' ``Push on! Push on!''\\*
\vin Said the hermit cheerily.\\!

`The boat came closer to the ship,\\*
\vin But I nor spake nor stirred;\\
The boat came close beneath the ship,\\*
\vin And straight a sound was heard.\\!

`Under the water it rumbled on,\\*
\vin Still louder \& more dread:\\
It reached the ship; it split the bay;\\*
\vin The ship went down like lead.\\!

`Stunned by that loud \& dreadful sound,\\*
\vin Which sky \& ocean smote,\\
Like one that hath been seven days drowned\\
\vin My body lay afloat;\\
But swift as dreams, myself I found\\*
\vin Within the pilot's boat.\\!

`Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,\\*
\vin The boat spun round \& round;\\
And all was still, save that the hill\\*
\vin Was telling of the sound.\\!

`I moved my lips -- the pilot shrieked\\*
\vin And fell down in a fit;\\
The holy hermit raised his eyes,\\*
\vin And prayed where he did sit.\\!

`I took the oars: the pilot's boy,\\*
\vin Who now doth crazy go,\\
Laughed loud \& long, and all the while\\
\vin His eyes went to \& fro.\\
``Ha ha!'' quoth he, ``Full plain I see,\\* 
\vin The devil knows how to row.''\\!

`And now, all in my own country,\\*
\vin I stood on the firm land.\\
The hermit stepped forth from the boat,\\*
\vin And scarcely he could stand.\\!

`{``}O shrieve me! Shrieve me, holy man!''\\*
\vin The hermit crossed his brow.\\
``Say quick,' quoth he, ``I bid thee say --\\*
\vin What manner of man art thou?''\\!

`Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched\\*
\vin With a woeful agony,\\
Which forced me to begin my tale;\\*
\vin And then it left me free.\\!

`Since then, at an uncertain hour,\\*
\vin That agony returns:\\
And till my ghastly tale is told,\\*
\vin This heart within me burns.\\!

`I pass, like night, from land to land;\\* 
\vin I have strange power of speech;\\
That moment that his face I see,\\
I know the man that must hear me:\\*
\vin To him my tale I teach.\\!

`What loud uproar bursts from that door!\\*
\vin The wedding-guests are there:\\
But in the garden-bower the bride\\
\vin And bride-maids singing are:\\
And hark the little vesper bell,\\*
\vin Which biddeth me to prayer!\\!

`O wedding-guest, this soul hath been\\* 
\vin Alone on a wide wide sea:\\
So lonely 'twas, that God himself\\*
\vin Scarce seem\`ed there to be.\\!

`O sweeter than the marriage-feast,\\*
\vin 'Tis sweeter far to me,\\
To walk together to the kirk\\*
\vin With a goodly company!\\!

`To walk together to the kirk,\\*
\vin And all together pray,\\
While each to his great Father bends,\\
Old men, and babes, and loving friends\\*
\vin And youths \& maidens gay!\\!

`Farewell, farewell! But this I tell\\*
\vin To thee, thou wedding-guest!\\
He prayeth well, who loveth well\\*
\vin Both man \& bird \& beast.\\!

`He prayeth best, who loveth best\\*
\vin All things both great \& small;\\
For the dear God who loveth us,\\*
\vin He made \& loveth all.'\\!

The mariner, whose eye is bright,\\*
\vin Whose beard with age is hoar,\\
Is gone: and now the wedding-guest\\*
\vin Turned from the bridegroom's door.\\!

He went like one that hath been stunned,\\*
\vin And is of sense forlorn:\\
A sadder \& a wiser man,\\*
\vin He rose the morrow morn.
