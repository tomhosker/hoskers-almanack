\poemlines{5}
These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;\footnotetext{Revelation 3.14-22. \cite{kjv}.}\\
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.\\
So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.\\
Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:\\
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.\\
As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.\\
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\\
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.\\
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
