\poemlines{5}
Weep you no more, sad fountains;\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{norton}. This beautiful song was very nearly ruined for the Almanackist by being sung by the emetic hypocrite Emma Thompson in hers and Alan Rickman's dreadful interpretation of \emph{Sense and Sensibility}.}\\
\vin What need you flow so fast?\\
Look how the snowy mountains\\
\vin Heaven's sun doth gently waste.\\
\vin But my sun's heav'nly eyes\\
\vin \vin View not your weeping,\\
\vin \vin That now lies sleeping,\\
\vin Softly, softly, now softly lies\\*
\vin \vin \vin Sleeping.\\!

Sleep is a reconciling,\\*
\vin A rest that peace begets.\\
Doth not the sun rise smiling\\
\vin When fair at e'en he sets?\\
\vin Rest you then, rest, sad eyes;\\
\vin \vin Melt not in weeping\\
\vin \vin While she lies sleeping,\\
\vin Softly, softly, now softly lies\\*
\vin \vin \vin Sleeping.
