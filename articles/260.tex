Only a man harrowing clods\footnotetext{`In Time of ``The Breaking of Nations{''}', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{norton}. This poem might well hold the record in the English canon for the longest gestation; for Hardy began working on it in 1870 following the Battle of Sedan, and only finished it in 1915 during the First World War. The title is an allusion to Jeremiah 51.20.}\\*
\vin In a slow silent walk\\
With an old horse that stumbles \& nods\\*
\vin Half asleep as they stalk.\\!

Only thin smoke without flame\\*
\vin From the heaps of couch-grass;\\
Yet this will go onward the same\\*
\vin Though dynasties pass.\\!

Yonder a maid \& her wight\\*
\vin Come whispering by:\\
War's annals will cloud into night\\*
\vin Ere their story die.
