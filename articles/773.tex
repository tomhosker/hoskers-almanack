\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
My father he left me an acre of land --\footnotetext{`An Acre of Land', Anon. \cite{albion_band}. The words are closely related to a passage from the second Child Ballad.}\\*
\vin {\it Sing hey! Sing ho! Sing hivy!}\\
My father he left me an acre of land --\\*
\vin {\it And a bunch of holly \& ivy!}\\!

And we ploughed it up with a ram's horn,\\*
And scattered it over with one peppercorn.\\!

And we reaped it with a sickle of leather,\\*
And tied it all up with a tomtit's feather.\\!

And we threshed it with a peddler's pack,\\*
\vin {\it Sing hey! Sing ho! Sing hivy!}\\
And carried it home on a butterfly's back.\\*
\vin {\it And a bunch of holly \& ivy!}\\!
