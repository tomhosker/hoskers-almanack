\vin She has finished \& sealed the letter\footnotetext{`Parting, without a Sequel', Prof John Ransom (1888 -- 1974). \cite{norton}.}\\*
At last, which he so richly has deserved,\\
With characters venomous \& hatefully curved,\\*
\vin And nothing could be better.\\!

\vin But even as she gave it\\*
Saying to the blue-capped functioner of doom,\\
`Into his hands,' she hoped the leering groom\\*
\vin Might somewhere lose \& leave it.\\!

\vin Then all the blood\\*
Forsook the face. She was too pale for tears,\\
Observing the ruin of her younger years.\\*
\vin She went and stood\\!

\vin Under her father's vaunting oak\\*
Who kept his peace in wind \& sun and glistened\\
Stoical in the rain; to whom she listened\\*
\vin If he spoke.\\!

\vin And now the agitation of the rain\\*
Rasped his sere leaves, and he talked low \& gentle\\
Reproaching the wan daughter by the lintel;\\*
\vin Ceasing \& beginning again.\\!

\vin Away went the messenger's bicycle;\\*
His serpentâ€™s track went up the hill forever,\\
And all the time she stood there hot as fever\\*
\vin And cold as any icicle.
