For us who, from the moment\footnotetext{`Address to the Beasts', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
We are first worlded,\\*
Lapse into disarray,\\!

Who seldom know exactly\\*
What we are up to,\\*
And, as a rule, don't want to,\\!

What a joy to know,\\*
Even when we can't see or hear you,\\*
That you are around,\\!

Though very few of you\\*
Find us worth looking at,\\*
Unless we come too close.\\!

To you all scents are sacred\\*
Except our smell \& those\\*
We manufacture.\\!

How promptly \& ably\\*
You execute nature's policies,\\*
And are never\\!

Lured into misconduct\\*
Except by some unlucky\\*
Chance imprinting.\\!

Endowed from birth with good manners,\\*
You wag no snobbish elbows,\\*
Don't leer,\\!

Don't look down your nostrils,\\*
Nor poke them into another\\*
Creature's business.\\!

Your own habitations\\*
Are cosy \& private, not\\*
Pretentious temples.\\!

Of course, you have to take lives\\*
To keep your own, but never\\*
Kill for applause.\\!

Compared with even your greediest,\\*
How non-U\\*
Our hunting gentry seem.\\!

Exempt from taxation,\\*
You have never felt the need\\*
To become literate,\\!

But your oral cultures\\*
Have inspired our poets to pen\\*
Dulcet verses,\\!

And, though unconscious of God,\\*
Your sung eucharists\\*
Are more hallowed than ours.\\!

Instinct is commonly said\\*
To rule you: I would call it\\*
Common sense.\\!

If you cannot engender\\*
A genius like \emph{Mozart},\\*
Neither can you\\!

Plague the earth\\*
With brilliant sillies like \emph{Hegel}\\*
Or clever nasties like \emph{Hobbes}.\\!

Shall we ever become adulted,\\*
As you all soon do?\\*
It seems unlikely.\\!

Indeed, one balmy day,\\*
We might all become\\*
Not fossils, but vapour.\\!

Distinct now,\\*
In the end we shall join you\\*
(How soon all corpses look alike),\\!

But you exhibit no signs\\*
Of knowing that you are sentenced.\\*
Now, could that be why\\!

We upstarts are often\\*
Jealous of your innocence,\\*
But never envious.
