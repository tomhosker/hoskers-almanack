\poemlines{5}
Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the {\hge LORD} is risen upon thee.\footnotetext{Isaiah 60.1-5. \cite{kjv}.}\\
For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the {\hge LORD} shall arise upon thee, and his
glory shall be seen upon thee.\\
And the gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.\\
Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from
far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.\\
Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee.
