It is the clay what makes the earth stick to his spade;\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `In Nunhead Cemetery', Miss Charlotte Mew (1869 -- 1928). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin He fills in holes like this year after year;\\
The others have gone; they were tired, and \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} afraid\\*
\vin But I would rather be standing here;\\!

There is nowhere else to go. I have seen this place\\*
\vin From the windows of the train that's going past\\
Against the sky. This is rain on my face;\\*
\vin It was raining here when I saw it last.\\!

There is something horrible about a flower;\\*
\vin This, broken in my hand, is one of those\\
He threw it in just now; it will not live another hour;\\*
\vin There are 1000s more; you do not miss a rose.\\!

One of the children hanging about\\*
\vin Pointed at the whole dreadful heap and smiled\\
This morning after th\'at was carried out;\\*
\vin There is something terrible about a child.\\!

We were like children last week, in the {\sc Strand};\\*
\vin That was the day you laughed at me\\
Because I tried to make you understand\\
\vin The cheap, stale chap I used to be\\*
\vin Before I saw the things you made me see.\\!

This is not a real place; perhaps by \& by\\*
\vin I shall wake -- I am getting drenched with all this rain:\\
Tomorrow I will tell you about the eyes of the {\sc Crystal Palace} train\\*
\vin Looking down on us, and you will laugh \& I shall see what you see again.\\!

\vin \vin Not here, not now. We said, `Not yet\\*
\vin \vin Across our low stone parapet\\*
\vin Will the quick shadows of the sparrows fall.'\\!

\vin \vin But still it was a lovely thing\\*
\vin \vin Through the grey months to wait for spring\\
\vin \vin With the birds that go a-gypsying\\
\vin In the parks till the blue seas call.\\
\vin \vin And next to these, you used to care\\
\vin \vin For the lions in {\sc Trafalgar Square},\\
Who'll stand \& speak for {\sc London} when her bell of judgement tolls --
\vin \vin And the gulls at {\sc Westminster} that were\\
\vin \vin The old sea-captains' souls.\\
Today again the brown tide splashes step by step, the river-stair,\\*
\vin \vin And the gulls are there!\\!

By a month we have missed our day:\\*
\vin The children would have hung about\\
Round the carriage \& over the way\\*
\vin As you \& I came out.\\!

We should have stood on the gulls' black cliffs \& heard the sea\\*
\vin And seen the moon's white track;\\
I would have called; you would have come to me\\*
\vin And kissed me back.\\!

You have never done that: I do not know\\*
\vin Why I stood staring at your bed\\
And heard you, though you spoke so low,\\
\vin But could not reach your hands, your little head;\\
There was nothing we could not do, you said,\\*
\vin And you went, and I let you go!\\!

Now I will burn you back; I will burn you through,\\*
\vin Though I am damned for it we two will lie\\
\vin And burn, here where the starlings fly\\
\vin To these white stones from the wet sky;\\
\vin Dear, you will say this is not I --\\*
It would not be you! It would not be you!\\!

If for only a little while\\*
\vin You will think of it you will understand;\\
\vin \vin If you will touch my sleeve \& smile\\
\vin As you did that morning in the {\sc Strand}\\
\vin \vin I can wait quietly with you\\
\vin \vin Or go away if you want me to --\\
God! What is God? But your face has gone \& your hand!\\*
\vin Let me stay here too.\\!

\vin \vin When I was quite a little lad\\*
\vin At Christmas time we went \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} mad\\
\vin \vin For joy of all the toys we had,\\
And then we used to sing about the sheep\\
\vin \vin The shepherds watched by night;\\
We used to pray to \emph{Christ} to keep\\
\vin \vin Our small souls safe till morning light;\\
I am scared; I am staying with you tonight --\\*
\vin \vin \vin \vin Put me to sleep.\\!

I shall stay here: here you can see the sky;\\*
The houses in the street are much too high;\\
\vin There is no one left to speak to there;\\
\vin Here they are everywhere,\\
And just above them fields \& fields of roses lie --\\*
If he would dig it all up again they would not die.
