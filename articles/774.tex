\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
There was an old couple lived under a hill,\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{herringbone}.}\\*
\vin And \empg{Blunt} it was their name O.\\
And they had a good beer and ale for to sell\\*
\vin And it bore a wonderful fame O.\\!

\emph{John Blunt} \& his wife they drank of the drink\\*
\vin Till they could drink no more O.\\
They both got tired and went up to bed\\*
\vin But forgot to bar the door O.\\!

So they made a bargain; a bargain they made.\\*
\vin They made it strong \& sure O.\\
The first of them to speak the first word\\*
\vin Gets up to bar the door O.\\!

So there came ramblers, ramblers three,\\*
\vin Travelling in the night O.\\
And so in need of lodgings were they,\\*
\vin They crept in by candlelight O.\\!

They went to his larder and ate up his food\\*
\vin Till they could eat no more O;\\
But never a word did the old couple speak\\*
\vin For fear of who stood at the door O.\\!

And down to his cellar they drank of his drink\\*
\vin Till they could drink no more O;\\
But never a word did the old couple speak\\*
\vin For fear of who stood at the door O.\\!

They went upstairs; they went to his room;\\*
\vin They broke it down the door O;\\
But never a word did the old couple speak\\*
\vin For fear of who stood at the door O.\\!

They hauled his wife all out of the bed,\\*
\vin Laid her out on the floor O.\\
Then up got \emph{John}, said, `It's time to be gone,'\\*
\vin For he could stand no more o.\\!

He said, `You've eaten my food and drunk of my drink,\\*
\vin And my wife you hurt full sore O.\\
`But you spoke the first word, \emph{John Blunt},' she said,\\*
\vin `So go down and bar the door O.'
