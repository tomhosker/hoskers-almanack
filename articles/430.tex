'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's,\footnotetext{`A Nocturnal upon St Lucy's Day, Being the Shortest Day', Very Rev Dr John Donne (1573 -- 1631). \cite{norton}. St Lucy's day falls on the thirteenth day of December in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Christmas, the twenty-fifth of December, being a kind of successor to a Roman festival in honour of the sun, was intended to fall on (or very close to) the winter solstice; however, due to the slight failings of the Julian calendar, by the seventeenth century the solstice actually occurred on the thirteenth. The Gregorian reforms essentially rectified the situation, although they've also anachronised a rather beautiful poem. The `goat' refers primarily to Aries, the sign of the zodiac corresponding to spring.}\\*
\emph{Lucy}'s, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks;\\
\vin The sun is spent, and now his flasks\\
\vin Send forth light squibs, no constant rays;\\
\vin \vin The world's whole sap is sunk;\\
The general balm th'hydroptic earth hath drunk,\\
Whither, as to the bed's feet, life is shrunk,\\
Dead \& interred; yet all these seem to laugh,\\*
Compared with me, who am their epitaph.\\!

Study me then, you who shall lovers be\\*
At the next world, that is, at the next spring;\\
\vin For I am every dead thing,\\
\vin In whom love wrought new alchemy.\\
\vin \vin For his art did express\\
A quintessence even from nothingness,\\
From dull privations, and lean emptiness;\\
He ruined me, and I am re-begot\\*
Of absence, darkness, death: things which are not.\\!

All others, from all things, draw all that's good,\\*
Life, soul, form, spirit, whence they being have;\\
\vin I, by love's limbeck, am the grave\\
\vin Of all that's nothing. Oft a flood\\
\vin \vin Have we two wept, and so\\
Drowned the whole world, us two; oft did we grow\\
To be two chaoses, when we did show\\
Care to aught else; and often absences\\*
Withdrew our souls, and made us carcasses.\\!

But I am by her death (which word wrongs her)\\*
Of the first nothing the elixir grown;\\
\vin Were I a man, that I were one\\
\vin I needs must know; I should prefer,\\
\vin \vin If I were any beast,\\
Some ends, some means; yea plants, yea stones detest,\\
And love; all, all some properties invest;\\
If I an ordinary nothing were,\\*
As shadow, a light and body must be here.\\!

But I am none; nor will my sun renew.\\*
You lovers, for whose sake the lesser sun\\
\vin At this time to the goat is run\\
\vin To fetch new lust, and give it you,\\
\vin \vin Enjoy your summer all;\\
Since she enjoys her long night's festival,\\
Let me prepare towards her, and let me call\\
This hour her vigil, and her eve, since this\\*
Both the year's, and the day's deep midnight is.
