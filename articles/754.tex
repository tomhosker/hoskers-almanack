\poemlines{5}
As I roved out one evening fair,\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{spanning_the_years}.}\\*
\vin It being the summertime to take the air,\\
I spied a sailor \& a lady gay,\\*
\vin And I stood to listen to hear what they would say.\\!

He said, `Fair lady, why do you roam,\\*
\vin For the day is spent and the night is on?'\\
She heaved a sigh while the tears did roll:\\*
\vin `For my dark-eyed sailor, so young \& stout \& bold.\\!

`'Tis seven long years since he left this land.\\*
\vin A ring he took from off his lily-white hand.\\
One \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} of the ring is still here with me,\\*
\vin But the other's rolling at the bottom of the sea.'\\!

He said, `You may drive him out of your mind.\\*
\vin Some other young man you will surely find.\\
Love turns aside and soon cold has grown.\\*
\vin Like the winter's morning, the hills are white with snow.'\\!

She said, `I'll never forsake my dear,\\*
\vin Although we're parted this many a year.\\
Genteel he was and a rake like you\\*
\vin To induce a maiden to slight the jacket blue.'\\!

One \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} of the ring did young \emph{William} show;\\*
\vin She ran distracted in grief \& woe,\\
Saying, `\emph{William}, \emph{William}, I have gold in store\\*
\vin For my dark-eyed sailor has proved his honour long.'\\!

And there is a cottage by yonder lea.\\*
\vin This couple's married and does agree.\\
So maids be loyal when your love's at sea,\\*
\vin For a cloudy morning brings in a sunny day.
