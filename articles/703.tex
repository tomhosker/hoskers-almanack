\poemlines{5}
This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines \& the hemlocks,\footnotetext{$\zeta$ Prof Henry Longfellow (1807 -- 1882). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,\\
Stand like druids of old, with voices sad \& prophetic,\\
Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms\\
Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean\\*
Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.\\!

This is the forest primeval; but where are the hearts that beneath it\\*
Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman?\\
Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of acadian farmers,\\
Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,\\
Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven?\\
Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers forever departed.\\
Scattered like dust \& leaves, when the mighty blasts of october\\
Seize them, and whirl them aloft, and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean.\\*
Naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of {\sc Grand-Pr\'e}.
