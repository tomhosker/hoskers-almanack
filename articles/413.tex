Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,\footnotetext{`Soul and Body', William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
Foiled by those rebel powers that thee array,\\
Why dost thou pine within, and suffer dearth,\\*
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?\\!

Why so large cost, having so short a lease,\\*
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?\\
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,\\*
Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?\\!

Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,\\*
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;\\
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;\\*
Within be fed, without be rich no more:--\\!

So shalt thou feed on death, that feeds on men;\\*
And death once dead, there's no more dying then.
\end{verse}
