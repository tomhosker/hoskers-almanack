\poemlines{5}
Pious \emph{Selinda} goes to prayers\footnotetext{William Congreve (1670 -- 1729). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin If I but ask the favour;\\
And yet the tender fool's in tears\\*
\vin When she believes I'll leave her.\\!

Would I were free from this restraint,\\*
\vin Or else had hopes to win her;\\
Would she could make of me a saint,\\*
\vin Or I of her a sinner.
\end{verse}
