Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean;\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Tears from the depth of some divine despair\\
Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\\
In looking on the happy autumn fields,\\*
And thinking of the days that are no more.\\!

Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\\*
That brings our friends up from the underworld,\\
Sad as the last which reddens over one\\
That sinks with all we love below the verge;\\*
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\\!

Ah sad \& strange as in dark summer dawns\\*
The earliest pipe of \sfrac{$1$}{$2$}-awakened birds\\
To dying ears, when unto dying eyes\\
The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\\*
So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\\!

Dear as remembered kisses after death,\\*
And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned\\
On lips that are for others; deep as love,\\
Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;\\*
O death in life, the days that are no more.\\!
