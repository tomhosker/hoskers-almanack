Farewell, ungrateful traitor;\footnotetext{John Dryden, Poet Laureate (1631 -- 1700). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin Farewell, my perjured swain.\\
Let never injured creature\\
\vin Believe a man again.\\
The pleasure of possessing\\
Surpasses all expressing,\\
But 'tis too short a blessing,\\*
\vin And love too long a pain.\\!

'Tis easy to deceive us\\*
\vin In pity of your pain,\\
But when we love you leave us\\
\vin To rail at you in vain.\\
Before we have descried it,\\
There is no bliss beside it,\\
But she that once has tried it\\*
\vin Will never love again.\\!

The passion you pretended\\*
\vin Was only to obtain,\\
But when the charm is ended\\
\vin The charmer you disdain.\\
Your love by ours we measure\\
Till we have lost our treasure,\\
But dying is a pleasure,\\*
\vin When living is a pain.
