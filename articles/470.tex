No one now imagines you answer idle questions\footnotetext{$dagger$ `Short Ode to the Cuckoo', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
-- How long shall I live? How long remain single?\\
Will butter be cheaper? -- nor does your shout make\\*
\vin Husbands uneasy.\\!

Compared with arias by the great performas\\*
Such as the merle, your two-note act is kid-stuff:\\
Our most hardened crooks are sincerely shocked by\\*
\vin Your nesting habits.\\!

Science, aesthetics, ethics may huff \& puff but they\\*
Cannot extinguish your magic: you marvel\\
The commuter as you wondered the savage.\\*
\vin Hence, in my diary,\\!

Where I normally enter nothing but social\\*
Engagements and, lately, the death of friends, I\\
Scribble year after year when I first hear you,\\*
\vin Of a holy moment.
