O goddess, hear these tuneless numbers, wrung\footnotetext{`Ode to Psyche', John Keats (1795 -- 1821). \cite{norton}. Psyche was a minor goddess of the Greco-Roman mythological tradition, whose marriage to Cupid (`\emph{Love}') and subsequent elevation to immortality were most famously related by Apuleius.}\\*
\vin By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,\\
And pardon that thy secrets should be sung\\
\vin Even into thine own soft-conch\`ed ear:\\
Surely I dreamt today, or did I see\\
\vin The winged \emph{Psyche} with awakened eyes?\\
I wandered in a forest thoughtlessly,\\
\vin And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,\\ 
Saw two fair creatures, couch\`ed side by side\\
\vin In deepest grass, beneath the whisp'ring roof\\
\vin Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran\\
\vin \vin A brooklet, scarce espied:\\
Mid hushed, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,\\
\vin Blue, silver-white, and budded tyrian,\\
They lay calm-breathing, on the bedded grass;\\ 
\vin Their arms embraced, and their pinions too;\\
\vin Their lips touched not, but had not bade adieu,\\ 
As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber,\\
And ready still past kisses to outnumber\\
\vin At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love:\\
\vin \vin The wing\`ed boy I knew;\\
\vin But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove?\\*
\vin \vin His \emph{Psyche} true!\\!

O latest born and loveliest vision far\\*
\vin Of all {\sc Olympus}' faded hierarchy!\\
Fairer than \emph{Phoebe}'s sapphire-regioned star,\\ 
\vin Or \emph{Vesper}, amorous glow-worm of the sky;\\
Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,\\
\vin \vin Nor altar heaped with flowers;\\
Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan\\
\vin \vin Upon the midnight hours;\\
No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet\\
\vin From chain-swung censer teeming;\\
No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat\\*
\vin Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming.\\!

O brightest! though too late for antique vows,\\*
\vin Too, too late for the fond believing lyre,\\
When holy were the haunted forest boughs,\\
\vin Holy the air, the water, and the fire;\\
Yet even in these days so far retired\\
\vin From happy pieties, thy lucent fans,\\
\vin Fluttering among the faint olympians,\\
I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired.\\
So let me be thy choir, and make a moan\\
\vin \vin Upon the midnight hours;\\
Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet\\
\vin From swing\`ed censer teeming;\\
Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat\\*
\vin Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming.\\!

Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane\\*
\vin In some untrodden region of my mind,\\
Where branch\`ed thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,\\
\vin Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind:\\
Far, far around shall those dark-clustered trees\\ 
\vin Fledge the wild-ridg\`ed mountains steep by steep;\\
And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,\\ 
\vin The moss-lain dryads shall be lulled to sleep;\\
And in the midst of this wide quietness\\
A rosy sanctuary will I dress\\
With the wreathed trellis of a working brain,\\
\vin With buds, and bells, and stars without a name,\\
With all the gardener fancy e'er could feign,\\
\vin Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same:\\
And there shall be for thee all soft delight\\
\vin That shadowy thought can win,\\
A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,\\*
\vin To let the warm \emph{Love} in!
