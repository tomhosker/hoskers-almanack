About suffering they were never wrong,\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `Mus{\'e}e des Beaux Arts', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}. The Mus{\'e}e des Beaux Arts in questions is to be found in Brussels.}\\*
The Old Masters: how well they understood\\
Its human position; how it takes place;\\
While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;\\
How, when the ag{\`e}d are reverently, passionately waiting\\
For the miraculous birth, there must always be\\
Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating\\
On a pond at the edge of the wood:\\
They never forgot\\
That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course\\
Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot\\
Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse\\*
Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.\\!

In \emph{Bruegel}'s {\hge Icarus}, for instance: how everything turns away\\*
Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may\\
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,\\
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone\\
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green\\
Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen\\
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,\\*
Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.
