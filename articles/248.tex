\poemlines{5}
When on my bed the moonlight falls,\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin So quickly, not as one that weeps\\
\vin I come once more; the city sleeps;\\*
I smell the meadow in the street;\\!

I hear a chirp of birds; I see\\*
\vin Betwixt the black fronts long-withdrawn\\
\vin A light-blue lane of early dawn,\\*
And think of early days \& thee,\\!

And bless thee, for thy lips are bland,\\*
\vin And bright the friendship of thine eye;\\
\vin And in my thoughts with scarce a sigh\\*
I take the pressure of thine hand.
\end{verse}
