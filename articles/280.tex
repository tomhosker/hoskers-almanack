O Lord, rebuke me not in thine indignation,\footnotetext{Psalm 6. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin Neither chasten me in thy displeasure.\\
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak;\\
\vin O Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed.\\
My soul also is sore troubled;\\
\vin But, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?\\
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul;\\
\vin O save me for thy mercy's sake.\\
For in death no man remembereth thee,\\
\vin And who will give thee thanks in the pit?\\
I am weary of my groaning; every night I wash my bed,\\
\vin And water my couch with my tears.\\
My beauty is gone for very trouble,\\
\vin And worn away because of all my enemies.\\
Away from me, all ye that work vanity,\\
\vin For the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.\\
The Lord hath heard my petition;\\
\vin The Lord will receive my prayer.\\
All my enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed;\\*
\vin They shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.
