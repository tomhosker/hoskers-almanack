Hereto I come to view a voiceless ghost;\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `After a Journey', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. The ghost in question is that of Hardy's first wife, Emma.}\\*
\vin Whither, O whither will its whim now draw me?\\
Up the cliff, down, till I'm lonely, lost,\\
\vin And the unseen waters' ejaculations awe me.\\
Where you will next be there's no knowing,\\
\vin Facing round about me everywhere,\\
\vin \vin With your nut-coloured hair,\\*
And grey eyes, and rose-flush coming \& going.\\!

Yes: I have re-entered your olden haunts at last;\\*
\vin Through the years, through the dead scenes I have tracked you;\\
What have you now found to say of our past --\\
\vin Scanned across the dark space wherein I have lacked you?\\
Summer gave us sweets, but autumn wrought division?\\
\vin Things were not lastly as firstly well\\
\vin \vin With us twain, you tell?\\*
But all's closed now, despite time's derision.\\!

I see what you are doing: you are leading me on\\*
\vin To the spots we knew when we haunted here together,\\
The waterfall, above which the mist-bow shone\\
\vin At the then fair hour in the then fair weather,\\
And the cave just under, with a voice still so hollow\\
\vin That it seems to call out to me from forty years ago,\\
\vin \vin When you were all aglow,\\*
And not the thin ghost that I now frailly follow.\\!

Ignorant of what there is flitting here to see,\\*
\vin The waked birds preen \& the seals flop lazily,\\
Soon you will have, dear, to vanish from me,\\
\vin For the stars close their shutters \& the dawn whitens hazily.\\
Trust me, I mind not, though life lours,\\
\vin The bringing me here; nay, bring me here again.\\
\vin \vin I am just the same as when\\*
Our days were a joy, \& our paths through flowers.
