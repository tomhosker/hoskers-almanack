How like a winter hath my absence been\footnotetext{William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
\vin From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\\
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,\\*
\vin What old december's bareness everywhere!\\!

And yet this time removed was summer's time:\\*
\vin The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,\\
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime\\*
\vin Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:\\!

Yet this abundant issue seemed to me\\*
\vin But hope of orphans, \& unfathered fruit;\\
For summer \& his pleasures wait on thee,\\*
\vin And, thou away, the very birds are mute;\\!

Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,\\*
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
\end{verse}
