\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I say, old man, your horse is dead.\footnotetext{`Poor Old Horse', Anon. \cite{sailors}. This song was sung during the famous ``dead horse'' ritual which a crew would undertake after their first month at sea.}\\*
\vin {\it And we say so! And we hope so!}\\
I say, old man your horse is dead.\\*
\vin {\it O poor old man!}\\!

One month a rotten life we've lead,\\*
While you lie on your feather bed.\\!

But now the month is up, old turk.\\*
Get up, you swine, and look for work.\\!

Get up, you swine, and look for graft,\\*
While we lays on and yanks you aft.\\!

And yanks you aft to the cabin door,\\*
\vin {\it And we say so! And we hope so!}\\
And hopes we'll never see you more.\\*
\vin {\it O poor old man!}\\!
