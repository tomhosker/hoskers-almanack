He talked of {\sc Delhi} brothels \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} the night,\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `Long Tom', Wilfrid Gibson (1878 -- 1962). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
Quaking with fever; and then, dragging tight\\
The frouzy blankets to his chattering chin,\\
Cursed for an hour because they were so thin\\
And nothing would keep out that gnawing cold --\\
Scarce 40 years of age, and yet so old,\\
Haggard and worn with burning eyes set deep --\\*
Until at last he cursed himself asleep.\\!

Before I'd shut my eyes reveille came;\\*
And as I dressed by the one candle-flame\\
The mellow golden light fell on his face\\
Still sleeping, touching it to tender grace,\\
Rounding the features life had scarred so deep,\\
Till youth came back to him in quiet sleep:\\
And then what women saw in him I knew\\*
And why they'd love him all his brief life through.
