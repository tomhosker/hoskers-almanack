Remember me when I am gone away,\footnotetext{Miss Christina Rossetti (1830 -- 1894). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
\vin Gone far away into the silent land;\\
\vin When you can no more hold me by the hand,\\
Nor I \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} turn to go yet turning stay.\\
Remember me when no more day by day\\
\vin You tell me of our future that you planned:\\
\vin Only remember me; you understand\\
It will be late to counsel then or pray.\\
Yet if you should forget me for a while\\
\vin And afterwards remember, do not grieve:\\
\vin For if the darkness \& corruption leave\\
\vin \vin A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,\\
Better by far you should forget, and smile\\*
\vin \vin Than that you should remember \& be sad.
