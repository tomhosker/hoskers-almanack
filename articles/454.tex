A slumber did my spirit seal;\footnotetext{Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
\vin I had no human fears:\\
She seemed a thing that could not feel\\*
\vin The touch of earthly years.\\!

No motion has she now, no force;\\*
\vin She neither hears nor sees;\\
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course\\*
\vin With rocks, \& stones, \& trees.
