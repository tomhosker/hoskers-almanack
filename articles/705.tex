To see a world in a grain of sand\footnotetext{$\xi$ `Auguries of Innocence', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
And a heaven in a wild flower,\\
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand\\
And eternity in an hour:\\
A robin redbreast in a cage\\
Puts all heaven in a rage.\\
A dove-house filled with doves \& pigeons\\
Shudders hell through all its regions.\\
A dog starved at his master's gate\\
Predicts the ruin of the state.\\
A horse misused upon the road\\
Calls to heaven for human blood.\\
A skylark wounded in the wing,\\
A cherubim does cease to sing.\\
The game cock clipped \& armed for fight\\
Does the rising sun affright.\\
Every wolf's \& lion's howl\\
Raises from hell a human soul.\\
The wild deer, wandering here \& there\\
Keeps the human soul from care.\\
The lamb misused breeds public strife\\
And yet forgives the butcher's knife.\\
The bat that flits at close of eve\\
Has left the brain that won't believe.\\
The owl that calls upon the night\\
Speaks the unbeliever's fright.\\
He who shall hurt the little wren\\
Shall never be beloved by men.\\
He who the ox to wrath has moved\\
Shall never be by woman loved.\\
The wanton boy that kills the fly\\
Shall feel the spider's enmity.\\
He who torments the chafer's sprite\\
Weaves a bower in endless night.\\
The beggar's dog \& widow's cat,\\
Feed them \& thou wilt grow fat.\\
The gnat that sings his summer's song\\
Poison gets from slander's tongue.\\
The poison of the snake \& newt\\
Is the sweat of envy's foot.\\
The poison of the honey bee\\
Is the artist's jealousy.\\
The prince's robes \& beggar's rags\\
Are toadstools on the miser's bags.\\
A truth that's told with bad intent\\
Beats all the lies you can invent.\\
The soldier armed with sword \& gun\\
Palsied strikes the summer's sun.\\
The poor man's farthing is worth more\\
Than all the gold on Afric's shore.\\
One mite wrung from the lab'rer's hands\\
Shall buy \& sell the miser's lands,\\
Or if protected from on high\\
Does that whole nation sell \& buy.\\
He who mocks the infant's faith\\
Shall be mocked in age \& death.\\
He who shall teach the child to doubt\\
The rotting grave shall ne'er get out.\\
He who respects the infant's faith\\
Triumphs over hell \& death.\\
The child's toys \& the old man's reasons\\
Are the fruits of the two seasons.\\
The questioner who sits so sly\\
Shall never know how to reply.\\
He who replies to words of doubt\\
Doth put the light of knowledge out.\\
The strongest poison ever known\\
Came from caesar's laurel crown.\\
Nought can deform the human race\\
Like to the armour's iron brace.\\
When gold \& gems adorn the plough\\
To peaceful arts shall envy bow.\\
A riddle or the cricket's cry\\
Is to doubt a fit reply.\\
The emmet's inch \& eagle's mile\\
Make lame philosophy to smile.\\
He who doubts from what he sees\\
Will ne'er believe do what you please.\\
God appears \& God is light\\
To those poor souls who dwell in night,\\
But does a human form display\\
To those who dwell in realms of day.
