When on my bed the moonlight falls,\footnotetext{$\xi$ Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin I know that in thy place of rest\\
\vin By that broad water of the west,\\*
There comes a glory on the walls;\\!

Thy marble bright in dark appears,\\*
\vin As slowly steals a silver flame\\
\vin Along the letters of thy name,\\*
And o'er the number of thy years.\\!

The mystic glory swims away;\\*
\vin From off my bed the moonlight dies;\\
\vin And closing eaves of wearied eyes\\*
I sleep till dusk is dipped in grey;\\!

And then I know the mist is drawn\\*
\vin A lucid veil from coast to coast,\\
\vin And in the dark church like a ghost\\* 
Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn.
