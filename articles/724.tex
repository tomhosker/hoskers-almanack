Here, ever since you went abroad,\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `What News', Walter Landor (1775 -- 1864). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin If there be change, no change I see;\\
I only walk our wonted road;\\*
\vin The road is only walked by me.\\!

Yes; I forgot; a change there is;\\*
\vin Was it of that you bade me tell?\\
I catch at times, at times I miss\\*
\vin The sight, the tone, I know so well.\\!

Only two months since you stood here!\\*
\vin Two shortest months! Then tell me why\\
Voices are harsher than they were,\\*
\vin And tears are longer ere they dry.
