\poemlines{5}
One day I wrote her name upon the strand,\footnotetext{$\xi$ Edmund Spencer (1552 -- 1599). \cite{norton}. This is one of Spenser's \emph{Amoretti}.}\\*
\vin But came the waves \& wash\`ed it away:\\
Again I wrote it with a second hand,\\
\vin But came the tide, and made my pains his prey.\\
\vin `Vain man,' said she, `that dost in vain assay,\\
\vin \vin A mortal thing so to immortalise;\\
\vin For I myself shall like to this decay,\\
\vin \vin And eke my name be wip\`ed out likewise.'\\
`Not so,' quod I. `Let baser things devise\\
\vin To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:\\
My verse your virtues rare shall eternise,\\
\vin And in the heavens write your glorious name:\\
Where whenas death shall all the world subdue,\\*
Our love shall live, and later life renew.'
\end{verse}
