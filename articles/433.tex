\vin When my grave is broke up again,\footnotetext{`The Relic', Very Rev Dr John Donne (1573 -- 1631). \cite{norton}. The Almanackist cannot help noticing that in the line, `A something else thereby', ``Jesus Christ'' would scan just as well as `something else', though this is pure speculation.}\\*
\vin Some second guest to entertain\\
\vin (For graves have learned that womanhead,\\
\vin To be to more than one a bed)\\
\vin \vin And he that digs it spies\\
A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,\\
\vin \vin Will he not let'us alone,\\
And think that there a loving couple lies,\\
Who thought that this device might be some way\\
To make their souls, at the last busy day,\\*
Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?\\!

\vin If this fall in a time, or land,\\*
\vin Where misdevotion doth command,\\
\vin Then he, that digs us up, will bring\\
\vin Us to the bishop \& the king,\\
\vin \vin To make us relics; then\\
Thou shalt be a \emph{Mary Magdalen}, and I\\
\vin \vin A something else thereby;\\
All women shall adore us, and some men;\\
And since at such time miracles are sought,\\
I would have that age by this paper taught\\*
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.\\!

\vin First, we loved well and faithfully,\\*
\vin Yet knew not what we loved, nor why;\\
\vin Difference of sex no more we knew\\
\vin Than our guardian angels do;\\
\vin \vin Coming \& going, we\\
Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;\\
\vin \vin Our hands ne'er touched the seals\\
Which nature, injured by late law, sets free;\\
These miracles we did, but now alas,\\
All measure, and all language, I should pass,\\*
Should I tell what a miracle she was.
