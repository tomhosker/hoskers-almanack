\poemlines{5}
God is a righteous judge, strong \& patient;\footnotetext{Psalm 7.12-17. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin And God is provoked every day.\\
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword;\\
\vin He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.\\
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death;\\
\vin He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.\\
Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity;\\
\vin He hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.\\
He hath graven \& digged up a pit,\\
\vin And is fallen himself into the destruction that he made for other.\\
For his travail shall come upon his own head,\\*
\vin And his wickedness shall fall on his own pate.
