The world's a stage. The trifling entrance fee\footnotetext{Hilaire Belloc (1870 -- 1953). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\* 
\vin Is paid (by proxy) to the registrar.\\
The orchestra is very loud \& free\\
\vin But plays no music in particular.\\
They do not print a programme, that I know.\\
\vin The cast is large. There isn't any plot.\\
The acting of the piece is far below\\
\vin The very worst of modernistic rot.\\
The only part about it I enjoy\\
\vin Is what was called in english the ``foyay''.\\
There will I stand apart awhile and toy\\
\vin With thought, and set my cigarette alight;\\
And then -- without returning to the play --\\*
\vin On with my coat and out into the night.
