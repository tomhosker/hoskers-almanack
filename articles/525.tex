The owl \& the pussy-cat went to sea\footnotetext{`The Owl and the Pussy-Cat', Edward Lear (1812 -- 1888). \cite{norton}. The Almanackist's (maternal) grandfather had a picture of `The Owl and the Pussy-Cat', and, while pointing out the said image, used to sing the poem to his grandson.}\\*
\vin In a beautiful pea-green boat;\\
They took some honey, and plenty of money,\\
\vin Wrapped up in a \pounds 5 note.\\
The owl looked up to the stars above,\\
\vin And sang to a small guitar,\\
`O lovely pussy! O pussy, my love,\\
\vin What a beautiful pussy you are,\\
\vin \vin You are,\\
\vin \vin You are!\\*
\vin What a beautiful pussy you are!'\\!

Pussy said to the owl, 'You elegant fowl!\\*
\vin How charmingly sweet you sing!\\
O let us be married! Too long we have tarried:\\
\vin But what shall we do for a ring?'\\
They sailed away, for a year \& a day,\\
\vin To the land where the bong tree grows\\
And there in a wood a piggy-wig stood\\
\vin With a ring at the end of his nose,\\
\vin \vin His nose,\\
\vin \vin His nose,\\*
\vin With a ring at the end of his nose.

`Dear pig, are you willing to sell for 1 s\\*
\vin Your ring?' Said the piggy, `I will.\\
So they took it away, and were married next day\\
\vin By the turkey who lives on the hill.\\
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,\\
\vin Which they ate with a runcible spoon;\\
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,\\
\vin They danced by the light of the moon,\\
\vin \vin The moon,\\
\vin \vin The moon,\\*
\vin They danced by the light of the moon.
