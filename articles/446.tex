\poemlines{5}
Move him into the sun --\footnotetext{`Futility', Wilfred Owen (1893 -- 1918). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Gently its touch awoke him once,\\
At home, whispering of fields \sfrac{$1$}{$2$}-sown.\\
\vin Always it woke him, even in France,\\
Until this morning \& this snow.\\
If anything might rouse him now\\*
The kind old sun will know.\\!

Think how it wakes the seeds --\\*
\vin Woke once the clays of a cold star.\\
Are limbs, so dear-achieved, are sides\\
\vin Full-nerved, still warm, too hard to stir?\\
Was it for this the clay grew tall?\\
O what made fatuous sunbeams toil\\*
To break earth's sleep at all?
\end{verse}
