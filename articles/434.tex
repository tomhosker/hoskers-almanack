Long neglect has worn away\footnotetext{Miss Emily Bront\"e (1818 -- 1848). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Half the sweet enchanting smile;\\
Time has turned the bloom to grey;\\*
\vin Mould \& damp the face defile.\\!

But that lock of silky hair,\\*
\vin Still beneath the picture twined,\\
Tells what once those features were,\\*
\vin Paints their image on the mind.\\!

Fair the hand that traced that line,\\*
\vin `Dearest, ever deem me true';\\
Swiftly flew the fingers fine\\*
\vin When the pen that motto drew.
