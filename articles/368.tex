Here lies, to each her parents' ruth,\footnotetext{`On My First Daughter', Ben Jonson (1572 -- 1637). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\emph{Mary}, the daughter of their youth;\\
Yet all heaven's gifts being heaven's due,\\
It makes the father less to rue.\\
At six months' end she parted hence\\
With safety of her innocence;\\
Whose soul heaven's queen, whose name she bears,\\
In comfort of her mother's tears,\\
Hath placed amongst her virgin-train:\\
Where, while that severed doth remain,\\
This grave partakes the fleshly birth;\\*
Which cover lightly, gentle earth.
\end{verse}
