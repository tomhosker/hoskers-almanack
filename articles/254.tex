Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}. This sonnet is taken from a larger work, \emph{The Princess}, and has been set to music by a number of famous composers.}\\*
Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;\\
Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font.\\*
The firefly wakens; waken thou with me.\\!

Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,\\*
And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.\\!

Now lies the earth all \emph{Dana\"e} to the stars,\\*
And all thy heart lies open unto me.\\!

Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves\\*
A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.\\!

Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,\\*
And slips into the bosom of the lake.\\
So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip\\*
Into my bosom and be lost in me.
