Downhill I came, hungry, and yet not starved;\footnotetext{`The Owl', Edward Thomas (1878 -- 1917). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Cold, yet had heat within me that was proof\\
Against the north wind; tired, yet so that rest\\*
\vin Had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof.\\!

Then at the inn I had food, fire, \& rest,\\*
\vin Knowing how hungry, cold, \& tired was I.\\
All of the night was quite barred out except\\*
\vin An owl's cry, a most melancholy cry\\!

Shaken out long \& clear upon the hill,\\*
\vin No merry note, nor cause of merriment,\\
But one telling me plain what I escaped\\*
\vin And others could not, that night, as in I went.\\!

And salted was my food, and my repose,\\*
\vin Salted \& sobered, too, by the bird's voice\\
Speaking for all who lay under the stars,\\*
\vin Soldiers \& poor, unable to rejoice.
