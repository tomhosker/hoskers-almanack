This feast-day of the sun, his altar there\footnotetext{`The Hill Summit', Gabriel Rossetti (1828 -- 1882). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin In the broad west has blazed for vesper-song;\\
\vin And I have loitered in the vale too long\\
And gaze now a belated worshipper.\\
Yet may I not forget that I was 'ware,\\
\vin So journeying, of his face at intervals\\
\vin Transfigured where the fringed horizon falls\\
A fiery bush with coruscating hair.\\
And now that I have climbed \& won this height,\\
\vin I must tread downward through the sloping shade\\
And travel the bewildered tracks till night.\\
\vin Yet for this hour I still may here be stayed\\
\vin And see the gold air \& the silver fade\\* 
And the last bird fly into the last light.
\end{verse}
