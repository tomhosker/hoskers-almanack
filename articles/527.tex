This said, the smith did to his bellows go,\footnotetext{$\xi$ George Chapman (?1559 -- 1634). \cite{obev}. This is a translation of Homer's {\greektext >Ili'as}, Book XVIII, lines 468-495. Prof Auden wrote his own poem (`The Shield of Achilles') concerning the same portion of Book XVIII.}\\*
Set them to fire, and made his cyclops blow:\\
Full 20 pair breathed through his furnace holes\\
All sorts of blasts t'enflame his tempered coals;\\
Now blusterd hard, and now did contrarise,\\
As \emph{Vulcan} would, and as his exercise\\
Might with perfection serve the dame's desire.\\
Hard brass \& tin he cast into the fire,\\
High-priz\`ed gold \& silver, and did set\\
Within the stock an anvil bright \& great:\\
His massy hammer then his right hand held;\\
His other hand his gasping tongs compelled.\\
And first he forged a huge \& solid shield,\\
Which every way did variant artship yield,\\
Through which he three ambitious circles cast,\\
Round \& refulgent; and without he placed\\
A silver handle; fivefold proof it was,\\
And in it many things with special grace,\\
And passing artificial pomp were graven;\\
In it was earth's green globe, the sea \& heaven,\\
Th'unwearied sun; the moon exactly round,\\
And all the stars with which the sky is crowned,\\
The \emph{Pleiades}, the \emph{Hyads} and the force\\
Of great \emph{Orion}; and the \emph{Bear}, whose course\\
Turns her about his sphere observing him\\
Surnamed the \emph{Chariot}, and doth never swim\\
Upon the unmeasured oceans' marble face,\\
Of all the flames that heaven's blue veil enchase.\\
In it two beautious cities he did build\\
Of divers-languaged men; the one was filled\\
With sacred nuptials \& with solemn feasts,\\
And through the streets the fair officious guests\\
Lead from their bridal chambers their fair brides\\
With golden torches burning by their sides.\\
\emph{Hymen}'s sweet triumphs were abundant there,\\
Of youths \& damsels dancing in a sphere;\\*
Amongst whom masking flutes \& harps were heard...
