Bless\`ed be the Lord God of Israel:\footnotetext{`The Benedictus'. \cite{bcp}. This song is a translation of Luke 1.68-79.}\\
\vin For he hath visited and redeemed his people;\\
And he hath raised up a mighty salvation for us:\\
\vin In the house of his servant \emph{David};\\
As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets:\\
\vin Which have been since the world began;\\
That we should be saved from our enemies:\\
\vin And from the hand of all that hate us;\\
To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers:\\
\vin And to remember his holy covenant;\\
To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather \emph{Abraham}:\\
\vin That he would give us;\\
That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies:\\
\vin Might serve him without fear;\\
In holiness \& righteousness before him:\\
\vin All the days of our life.\\
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:\\
\vin For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;\\
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people:\\
\vin For the remission of their sins,\\
Through the tender mercy of our God:\\
\vin Whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us;\\
To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death:\\
\vin To guide our feet into the way of peace.
