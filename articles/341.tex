\poemlines{5}
Thus saith God the {\hge LORD}, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:\footnotetext{Isaiah 42.5-8. \cite{kjv}.}\\
I the {\hge LORD} have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the gentiles;\\
To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.\\
I am the {\hge LORD}: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
