I woke. You were not there. But as I dressed\footnotetext{From `The Lesson', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}. This is the last verse of a much longer poem.}\\*
Anxiety turned to shame, feeling all three\\
Intended one rebuke. For had not each\\
In its own way tried to teach\\
My will to love you that it cannot be,\\
As I think, of such consequence to want\\*
What anyone is given, if they want?
