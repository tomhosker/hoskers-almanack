Here lies wise and valiant dust\footnotetext{$\xi$ `Epitaph on the Earl of Strafford', Rev Dr Clement Paman (1612 -- 1664). \cite{obev}. Strafford, one of the Charles I's ministers, offered himself up to the king as a sacrifice to appease a certain faction in the House of Commons, and was duly beheaded. Ricks notes that others have attributed this poem to John Cleveland.}\\* 
Huddled up 'twixt fit \& just,\\
\emph{Strafford}, who was hurried hence\\
'Twixt treason \& convenience.\\
He spent his time here in a mist,\\
A papist, yet a calvinist;\\
His prince's nearest joy \& grief,\\
He had, yet wanted all relief;\\
The prop \& ruin of the state;\\
The people's violent love \& hate;\\
One in extremes loved \& abhorred.\\
Riddles lie here, or in a word,\\
Here lies blood; and let it lie\\*
Speechless still and never cry.
