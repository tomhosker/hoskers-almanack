\poemlines{5}
{\color{white} I have foresworn.} Of her society\footnotetext{William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616) \cite{shakespeare}. These lines are uttered by Iris (1-11) and Ceres (12-13) in \emph{The Tempest} IV.1.}\\*
Be not afraid. I met her deity\\
Cutting the clouds towards {\sc Paphos}, and her son\\
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done\\
Some wanton charm upon this man \& maid,\\
Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid\\
Till \emph{Hymen}'s torch be lighted -- but in vain.\\
\emph{Mars}'s hot minion is returned again.\\
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\\
Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows\\
And be a boy right out.\\
{\color{white} And be a boy right out.} Highest queen of state,\\*
Great \emph{Juno}, comes. I know her by her gait.
