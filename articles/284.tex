\poemlines{5}
God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.\footnotetext{Wisdom of Solomon 2.23-24, 3.1-4,7-8. \cite{kjv}.}\\
Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.\\
But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them.\\
In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery,\\
And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace.\\
For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality.\\
In the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to \& fro like sparks among the stubble.\\
They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the peoples, and their Lord shall reign for ever.
