How sweet is the shepherd's sweet lot;\footnotetext{`The Shepherd', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
\vin From the morn to the evening he strays;\\
He shall follow his sheep all the day,\\*
\vin And his tongue shall be filled with praise.\\!

For he hears the lamb's innocent call,\\*
\vin And he hears the ewe's tender reply;\\
He is watchful while they are in peace,\\*
\vin For they know when their shepherd is nigh.
