When the voices of children are heard on the green\footnotetext{`Nurse's Song', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}. This is the `Nurse's Song' from \emph{Songs of Innocence}; a kind of sequel, also called `Nurse's Song', appears in \emph{Songs of Experience}.}\\*
\vin And laughing is heard on the hill,\\
My heart is at rest within my breast,\\*
\vin And everything else is still.\\!

Then come home, my children; the sun is gone down,\\*
\vin And the dews of night arise;\\
Come; come; leave off play, and let us away\\*
\vin Till the morning appears in the skies.\\!

`No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,\\*
\vin And we cannot go to sleep;\\
Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,\\*
\vin And the hills are all covered with sheep.'\\!

Well, well, go \& play till the light fades away,\\*
\vin And then go home to bed.\\
The little ones leaped \& shouted \& laughed,\\*
\vin And all the hills echo√®d.
