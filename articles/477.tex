Shall I, wasting in despair,\footnotetext{`The Manly Heart', George Wither (1588 -- 1667). \cite{treasury}. The title would seem to be Palgrave's invention.}\\*
Die because a woman's fair?\\
Or make pale my cheeks with care\\
'Cause another's rosy are?\\
Be she fairer than the day,\\
Or the flowery meads in may --\\
\vin If she be not so to me,\\*
\vin What care I how fair she be?\\!

Shall my foolish heart be pined\\*
'Cause I see a woman kind?\\
Or a well-disposed nature\\
Join\`ed with a lovely feature?\\
Be she meeker, kinder, than\\
Turtle dove or pelican,\\
\vin If she be not so to me,\\*
\vin What care I how kind she be?\\!

Shall a woman's virtues move\\*
Me to perish for her love?\\
Or her merits' value known\\
Make me quite forget mine own?\\
Be she with that goodness blest\\
Which may gain her name of Best;\\
\vin If she seem not such to me,\\*
\vin What care I how good she be?\\!

'Cause her fortune seems too high\\*
Shall I play the fool and die?\\
Those that bear a noble mind\\
Where they want of riches find,\\
Think what with them they would do\\
That without them dare to woo;\\
\vin And unless that mind I see,\\*
\vin What care I how great she be?\\!

Great or good, or kind or fair,\\*
I will ne'er the more despair:\\
If she love me, this believe,\\
I will die ere she shall grieve;\\
If she slight me when I woo,\\
I can scorn and let her go;\\
\vin For if she be not for me,\\*
\vin What care I for whom she be?
