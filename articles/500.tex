\poemlines{5}
Go, my songs, to the lonely and the unsatisfied;\footnotetext{`Commission', Ezra Pound (1885 -- 1972). \cite{newlove}. \P `Mortmain' (literally ``dead hand'') is an obscure piece of Anglo-Norman legalese which refers to the manner in which a legal person -- as opposed to a literal or ``natural'' person -- owns land. Said legal person was, more often than not, some sort of religious organisation.}\\*
Go also to the nerve-racked; go to the enslaved-by-convention.\\
Bear to them my contempt for their oppressors.\\
Go as a great wave of cool water;\\*
Bear my contempt of oppressors.\\

Speak against unconscious oppression;\\*
Speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative;\\
Speak against bonds.\\
Go to the {\hge bourgeoise} who is dying of her ennuis;\\
Go to the women in suburbs.\\
Go to the hideously wedded;\\
Go to them whose failure is concealed;\\
Go to the unluckily mated;\\
Go to the bought wife;\\*
Go to the woman entailed.\\!

Go to those who have delicate lust;\\*
Go to those whose delicate desires are thwarted;\\*
Go like a blight upon the dulness of the world;\\
Go with your edge against this;\\
Strengthen the subtle cords;\\
Bring confidence upon the algae \& the tentacles of the soul.\\
Go in a friendly manner;\\
Go with an open speech.\\
Be eager to find new evils \& new good;\\
Be against all forms of oppression.\\
Go to those who are thickened with middle age,\\*
To those who have lost their interest.\\!

Go to the adolescent who are smothered in family --\\*
O how hideous it is\\
To see three generations of one house gathered together!\\
It is like an old tree with shoots,\\*
And with some branches rotted \& falling.\\!

Go out and defy opinion;\\*
Go against this vegetable bondage of the blood.\\*
Be against all sorts of mortmain.
