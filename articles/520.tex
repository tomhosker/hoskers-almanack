Of thee, kind boy, I ask no red \& white,\footnotetext{Sir John Suckling (1609 -- 1642). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin To make up my delight;\\
\vin No odd becoming graces,\\
Black eyes, or little know-not-whats in faces;\\
Make me but made enough, give me good store\\
Of love for her I count:\\
\vin I ask no more;\\*
'Tis love in love that makes the sport.\\!

There's no such thing as what we beauty call;\\*
\vin It is mere cozenage all:\\
\vin For though some, long ago,\\
Liked certain colours mingled so \& so,\\
That doth not tie me now from choosing new;\\
If I a fancy take\\
\vin To black \& blue,\\*
That fancy doth it beauty make.\\!

'Tis not the meat, but 'tis the appetite\\*
\vin Makes eating a delight;\\
\vin And if I like one dish\\
More than another, that a pheasant is;\\
What in our watches, that in us is found:\\
So to the height \& nick\\
\vin We up be wound,\\*
No matter by what hand or trick.
