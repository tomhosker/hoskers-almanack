It is time to go now.\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{ac4}. Padstow is a fishing village on the north coast of Cornwall.}\\*
{\it Haul away your anchor!\\
Haul away your anchor!\\*
'Tis our sailing time!}\\!

Get some sail upon her.\\*
{\it Haul away your halyards! \&c.}\\!

Get her on her course now.\\*
{\it Haul away your foresheets! \&c.}\\!

Waves are surging under.\\*
{\it Haul away down-channel!\\
Haul away down-channel\\*
On the evening tide!}\\!

When your sailing's over:\\*
{\it Haul away for heaven!\\
Haul away for heaven!\\*
God be by your side!}
