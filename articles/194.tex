When you are old \& grey \& full of sleep,\footnotetext{William Yeats (1865 -- 1939). \cite{norton}. This poem is a translation of a sonnet by the French poet Pierre de Ronsard; the Almanackist is not qualified to judge how faithful it is.}\\*
\vin And nodding by the fire, take down this book,\\
\vin And slowly read, and dream of the soft look\\*
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\\!

How many loved your moments of glad grace,\\*
\vin And loved your beauty with love false or true,\\
\vin But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\\*
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;\\!

And bending down beside the glowing bars,\\*
\vin Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled\\
\vin And paced upon the mountains overhead\\*
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
\end{verse}
