\poemlines{5}
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord,\footnotetext{Psalm 10.1-2,6,8-9,13,17. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin And hidest thy face in the needful time of trouble?\\
The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor;\\
\vin Let them be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.\\
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down;\\
\vin There shall no harm happen unto me.\\
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets,\\
\vin And privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.\\
For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in his den,\\
\vin That he may ravish the poor.\\
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand;\\
\vin Forget not the poor.\\
Break thou the power of the ungodly \& malicious;\\*
\vin Search out his ungodliness, until thou find none.
