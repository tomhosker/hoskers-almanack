Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;\footnotetext{`On My First Son', Ben Jonson (1572 -- 1637). \cite{norton}. The name Benjamin, the name of the departed child, means ``son of my right side''.}\\*
My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy.\\
Seven years tho' wert lent to me, and I thee pay,\\
Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.\\
O could I lose all father now! For why\\
Will man lament the state he should envy?\\
To have so soon 'scaped world's \& flesh's rage,\\
And if no other misery, yet age?\\
Rest in soft peace, and, asked, say, `Here doth lie\\
\emph{Ben Jonson} his best piece of poetry' --\\
For whose sake henceforth all his vows be such,\\
As what he loves may never like too much.
\end{verse}
