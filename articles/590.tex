\poemlines{5}
I see you, \emph{Juliet}, still, with your straw hat\footnotetext{`Farewell to Juliet', Wilfrid Blunt (1828 -- 1882). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. This is from Blunt's somewhat disappointing (in the light of the brilliance of this poem) series, \emph{Love Sonnets of Proteus}.}\\*
\vin Loaded with vines, and with your dear pale face,\\
On which those 30 years so lightly sat,\\
\vin And the white outline of your muslin dress.\\
You wore a little {\hge fichu} trimmed with lace\\
\vin And crossed in the front, as was the fashion then,\\
Bound at your waist with a broad band or sash,\\
\vin All white \& fresh \& virginally plain.\\
There was a sound of shouting far away\\
\vin Down in the valley, as they called to us,\\
And you, with hands clasped seeming still to pray\\
\vin Patience of fate, stood listening to me thus\\
With heaving bosom. There a rose lay curled.\\*
It was the reddest rose in all the world.
