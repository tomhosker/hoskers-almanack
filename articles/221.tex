The soul's dark cottage, battered \& decayed,\footnotetext{From `Of the Last Verses in the Book', Edmund Waller (1606 -- 1687). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Lets in new light through chinks that time has made;\\
Stronger by weakness, wiser men become\\
As they draw near to their eternal home:\\
Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view,\\*
That stand upon the threshold of the new.
\end{verse}
