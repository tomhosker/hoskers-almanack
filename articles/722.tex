From low to high doth dissolution climb,\footnotetext{`Mutability', Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
\vin And sink from high to low, along a scale\\
\vin Of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail;\\
A musical but melancholy chime,\\
Which they can hear who meddle not with crime,\\
\vin Nor avarice, nor over-anxious care.\\
\vin Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear\\
The longest date do melt like frosty rime,\\
That in the morning whitened hill \& plain\\
\vin And is no more; drop like the tower sublime\\
\vin \vin Of yesterday, which royally did wear\\
His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain\\
\vin \vin Some casual shout that broke the silent air,\\*
\vin Or the unimaginable touch of time.
\end{verse}
