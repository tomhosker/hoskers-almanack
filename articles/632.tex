\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
I love to see those loving \& beloved\footnotetext{$\dagger$ `Lonely Love', Prof Edmund Blunden (1896 -- 1974). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
Whom nature seems to have spited; unattractive,\\
Unnoticeable people, whose dry track\\
No honey-drop of praise, or understanding,\\
Or bare acknowledgement that they existed,\\*
Perhaps yet moistened. Still, they make their world.\\!

She with her arm in his -- O fate, be kind;\\*
Though late, be kind; let her have never cause\\
To live outside her dream, nor unadore\\
This underling in body, mind \& type,\\
Nor part from him what makes her dwarfish form\\*
Take grace \& fortune, envy's antitone.\\!

I saw where through the plain a river \& road\\
Ran quietly, and asked no more event\\
Than sun \& rain \& wind, and night \& day,\\
Two walking -- from what cruel show escaped?\\
Deformity, defect of mind their portion.\\
But I forget the rest of that free day of mine,\\
And in what flowerful coils, what airy music\\
It led me here \& on; these two I see\\
Who, loving, walking slowly, saw me not,\\*
But shared with me the strangest happiness.
