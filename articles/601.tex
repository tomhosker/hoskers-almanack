Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\footnotetext{`To His Love', William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
Thou art more lovely \& more temperate:\\
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may,\\*
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;\\!

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\\*
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;\\
And every fair from fair sometime declines,\\*
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed.\\!

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\\*
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;\\
Nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade,\\*
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:--\\!

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\\*
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
\end{verse}
