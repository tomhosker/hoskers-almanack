\poemlines{5}
The {\hge LORD} is my shepherd;\footnotetext{Psalm 23. \cite{kjv}.}\\*
\vin I shall not want.\\
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:\\
\vin He leadeth me beside the still waters.\\
He restoreth my soul:\\*
\vin He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.\\!

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:\\*
\vin For thou art with me; thy rod \& thy staff they comfort me.\\!

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:\\*
\vin Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.\\
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:\\*
\vin And I will dwell in the house of the {\hge LORD} for ever.
\end{verse}
