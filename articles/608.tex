\poemlines{5}
The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall,\footnotetext{`A Silent Love', Sir Edward Dyer (d. 1607). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
The fly his spleen, the little spark his heat;\\
The slender hairs cast shadows, though but small,\\
And bees have stings, although they be not great;\\
\vin Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs;\\*
\vin And love is love, in beggars \& in kings.\\!

Where waters smoothest run, there deepest are the fords;\\*
The dial stirs, yet none perceives it move;\\
The firmest faith is found in fewest words;\\
The turtles do not sing, and yet they love;\\
\vin True hearts have ears \& eyes, no tongues to speak;\\*
\vin They hear \& see, and sigh, and then they break.
\end{verse}
