Sweet, be not proud of those two eyes,\footnotetext{`To Dianeme', Robert Herrick (1591 -- 1674). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
Which starlike sparkle in their skies;\\
Nor be you proud that you can see\\
All hearts your captives, yours yet free;\\
Be you not proud of that rich hair\\
Which wantons with the lovesick air;\\
Whenas that ruby which you wear,\\
Sunk from the tip of your soft ear,\\
Will last to be a precious stone\\*
When all your world of beauty's gone.
\end{verse}
