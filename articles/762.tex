\poemlines{5}
I cannot get to my love if I would dee,\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{spinners}.}\\*
\vin The waters of {\sc Tyne} run between her \& me.\\
And here I must stand with a tear in my e'e,\\*
\vin Both sighing \& sickly my sweetheart to see.\\!

O where is the boatman, my bonnie hinny?\\*
\vin Where is the boatman? Bring him to me,\\
To ferry me over the {\sc Tyne} to my hinny,\\*
\vin And I will remember the boatman \& thee.\\!

O bring me the boatman. I'll gi'e all my money,\\*
\vin And you for your trouble rewarded shall be.\\
To ferry me o'er the {\sc Tyne} to my honey\\*
\vin Or scull her across the rough river to me.
\end{verse}
