Our God, our help in ages past,\footnotetext{Dr Isaac Watts (1674 -- 1648). \cite{norton}. This poem is a paraphrase of Psalm 90.}\\* 
\vin Our hope for years to come,\\
Our shelter from the stormy blast,\\*
\vin And our eternal home!\\!

Under the shadow of thy throne\\*
\vin Thy saints have dwelt secure;\\
Sufficient is thine arm alone,\\*
\vin And our defense is sure.\\!

Before the hills in order stood\\*
\vin Or earth received her frame,\\
From everlasting thou art God,\\*
\vin To endless years the same.\\!

A 1000 ages in thy sight\\*
\vin Are like an evening gone,\\
Short as the watch that ends the night\\*
\vin Before the rising sun.\\!

Thy word commands our flesh to dust:\\*
\vin `Return, ye sons of men!'\\
All nations rose from earth at first\\*
\vin And turn to earth again.\\!

Time, like an ever-rolling stream,\\*
\vin Bears all its sons away;\\
They fly forgotten as a dream\\*
\vin Dies at the opening day.
