As I drive to the junction of lane \& highway,\footnotetext{$\zeta \dagger$ `At Castle Boterel', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{ptmgmc}. Kastel Boterel is the Cornish-language name for the English village of Boscastle. The village is named after a nearby castle (of which very little survives) which itself was named after the Barons Botreaux (pronounced like the English word \emph{buttery}), a title in the Peerage of England in abeyance at the time of writing.}\\*
\vin And the drizzle bedrenches the waggonette,\\
I look behind at the fading byway,\\
\vin And see on its slope, now glistening wet,\\*
\vin \vin Distinctly yet\\!

Myself and a girlish form benighted\\*
\vin In dry march weather. We climb the road\\
Beside a chaise. We had just alighted\\
\vin To ease the sturdy pony's load\\*
\vin \vin When he sighed \& slowed.\\!

What we did as we climbed, and what we talked of\\*
\vin Matters not much, nor to what it led --\\
Something that life will not be balked of\\
\vin Without rude reason till hope is dead,\\*
\vin \vin And feeling fled.\\!

It filled but a minute. But was there ever\\*
\vin A time of such quality, since or before,\\
In that hill's story ? To one mind never,\\
\vin Though it has been climbed, foot-swift, foot-sore,\\*
\vin \vin By 1000s more.\\!

Primeval rocks form the road's steep border,\\*
\vin And much have they faced there, first \& last,\\
Of the transitory in earth's long order;\\
\vin But what they record in colour \& cast\\*
\vin \vin Is -- that we two passed.\\!

And to me, though time's unflinching rigour,\\*
\vin In mindless rote, has ruled from sight\\
The substance now, one phantom figure\\
\vin Remains on the slope, as when that night\\*
\vin \vin Saw us alight.\\!

I look \& see it there, shrinking, shrinking;\\*
\vin I look back at it amid the rain\\
For the very last time; for my sand is sinking,\\
\vin And I shall traverse old love's domain\\*
\vin \vin Never again.
