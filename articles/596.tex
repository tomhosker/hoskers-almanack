My love in her attire doth show her wit,\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{treasury}.}\\*
\vin It doth so well become her:\\
For every season she hath dressings fit,\\
\vin For winter, spring \& summer.\\
No beauty she doth miss\\
When all her robes are on;\\
But beauty's self she is\\*
When all her robes are gone.
