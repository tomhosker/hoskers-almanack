There's much afoot in heaven \& earth this year;\footnotetext{`The Raining Summer', Mrs Alice Meynell (1847 -- 1922). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
\vin The winds hunt up the sun, hunt up the moon,\\
Trouble the dubious dawn, hasten the drear\\*
\vin Height of a threatening noon.\\!

No breath of boughs, no breath of leaves, of fronds,\\*
\vin May linger or grow warm; the trees are loud;\\
The forest, rooted, tosses in her bonds,\\*
\vin And strains against the cloud.\\!

No scents may pause within the garden-fold;\\*
\vin The rifled flowers are cold as ocean-shells;\\
Bees, humming in the storm, carry their cold\\*
\vin Wild honey to cold cells.
\end{verse}
