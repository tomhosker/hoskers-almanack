{\color{red} Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name;}\footnotetext{`The Lord's Prayer'. \cite{bcp}. Ll. 1-4 are a translation of Matthew 6.9-13. The doxology is of uncertain origin; a version of it appears in the \textgreek{Didaq'h} (``Teaching of the Twelve Apostles''), and in certain (Byzantine) manuscripts of Matthew.}\\
{\color{red} Thy kingdom come; thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven:\\
Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us;\\
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.}\\
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever \& ever. Amen.
