Hark, all you ladies that do sleep;\footnotetext{$\xi$ Dr Thomas Campion (1567 -- 1620). \cite{obev}. \P Dione's oracle at Dodona was said to have been founded at the command of a black dove. \P Avernus is a volcanic crater in Campania, believed by the Romans to be an entrance into Hades; an obscure proverb states that women who die unwed will have to lead some sort of procession of primates through this netherworld; for instance, one reads in \emph{The London Prodigal} (a Jacobean play of uncertain authorship) that, `'Tis an old proverb, and you know it well,/ That women dying maids lead apes in hell.'}\\*
The fairy queen \emph{Proserpina}\\
Bids you awake and pity them that weep.\\
\vin You may do in the dark\\
\vin \vin What the day doth forbid;\\
\vin Fear not the dogs that bark;\\*
\vin \vin Night will have all hid.\\!

But if you let your lovers moan,\\*
The fairy queen \emph{Proserpina}\\
Will send abroad her fairies ev'ry one,\\
\vin That shall pinch black \& blue\\
\vin \vin Your white hands \& fair arms\\
\vin That did not kindly rue\\*
\vin \vin Your paramour's harms.\\!

In myrtle arbours on the downs\\*
The fairy queen \emph{Proserpina},\\
This night by moonshine leading merry rounds\\
\vin Holds a watch with sweet love,\\
\vin \vin Down the dale, up the hill;\\
\vin No plaints or groans may move\\*
\vin \vin Their holy vigil.\\!

All you that will hold watch with love,\\*
The fairy queen \emph{Proserpina}\\
Will make you fairer than \emph{Dione}'s dove;\\
\vin Roses red, lilies white,\\
\vin \vin And the clear damask hue,\\
\vin Shall on your cheeks alight:\\*
\vin \vin Love will adorn you.\\!

All you that love, or loved before,\\*
The fairy queen \emph{Proserpina}\\
Bids you increase that loving humour more:\\
\vin They that yet have not fed\\
\vin \vin On delight amorous,\\
\vin She vows that they shall lead\\*
\vin \vin Apes in {\sc Avernus}.
