I've oft been told by learn\`ed friars\footnotetext{`An Argument', Thomas Moore (1779 -- 1852). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin That wishing and the crime are one,\\
And heaven punishes desires\\*
\vin As much as if the deed were done.\\!

If wishing damns us, you \& I\\*
\vin Are damned to all our heart's content;\\
Come, then, at least we may enjoy\\*
\vin Some pleasure for our punishment.
\end{verse}
