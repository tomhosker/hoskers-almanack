\poemlines{5}
Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass --\footnotetext{`The Silent Noon', Gabriel Rossetti (1828 -- 1882). \cite{norton}. This is from Rossetti's sequence of sonnets, \emph{The House of Life}.}\\*
\vin The finger-points look through like rosy blooms:\\
\vin Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams \& glooms\\
'Neath billowing skies that scatter \& amass.\\
All round our nest, far as the eye can pass,\\
\vin Are golden kingcup fields with silver edge\\
\vin Where the cow parsley skirts the hawthorn hedge.\\*
'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass.\\!

Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly\\*
Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:\\
\vin So this winged hour is dropped to us from above.\\
\vin \vin O clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower,\\
\vin \vin This close-companioned inarticulate hour\\*
\vin When twofold silence was the song of love.
\end{verse}
