\poemlines{5}
He's gone, and all our plans\footnotetext{`To His Love', Ivor Gurney (1890 -- 1937). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Are useless indeed.\\
We'll walk no more on Cotswold\\
\vin Where the sheep feed\\*
\vin Quietly and take no heed.\\!

His body that was so quick\\*
\vin Is not as you\\
Knew it, on {\sc Severn River}\\
\vin Under the blue\\*
\vin Driving our small boat through.\\!

You would not know him now...\\*
\vin But still he died\\
Nobly, so cover him over\\
\vin With violets of pride\\*
\vin Purple from {\sc Severn} side.\\!

Cover him! Cover him soon!\\*
\vin And with thick-set\\
Masses of memoried flowers\\
\vin Hide that red wet\\*
\vin Thing I must somehow forget.
