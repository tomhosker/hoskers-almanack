\poemlines{5}
`A wager with you, my pretty fair maid,\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{rusby_little_lights}.}\\*
\vin Five hundred pounds to your 10:\\
A maid you will go to the merry green broom,\\
\vin And a maid you'll no longer return O.'\\
`A wager, a wager with you, kind sir,\\
\vin Five hundred pounds to my 10:\\
A maid I will go to the merry green broom,\\*
\vin And a maid I will boldly return.'\\!

The maiden she sat in her bower alone:\\*
\vin She is in torment \& strife:\\
`If I don't go to the broom this night,\\
\vin My love he won't make me his wife O.'\\
So up and she's gone on her good white steed,\\
\vin Away for her young man to meet.\\
She found him there and all fast asleep,\\*
\vin With a blood red rose at his feet.\\!

She's kissed him twice on cheek and on chin,\\*
\vin Then over his body did lean.\\
There she did place five rings on his chest\\
\vin Just so he would know she had been O.\\
Then off through the woods the young maid did go,\\
\vin Just when her love did arise.\\
He saw the five rings laid there on his chest;\\*
\vin On his face was nought but surprise.
