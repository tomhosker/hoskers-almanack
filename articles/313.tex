Praise ye the {\hge LORD}: for it is good to sing praises unto our God;\footnotetext{Psalm 147.1-11. \cite{kjv}.}\\*
\vin For it is pleasant; and praise is comely.\\
The {\hge LORD} doth build up Jerusalem:\\
\vin He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.\\
He healeth the broken in heart,\\
\vin And bindeth up their wounds.\\
He telleth the number of the stars;\\
\vin He calleth them all by their names.\\
Great is our {\hge LORD}, and of great power:\\
\vin His understanding is infinite.\\
The {\hge LORD} lifteth up the meek:\\
\vin He casteth the wicked down to the ground.\\
Sing unto the {\hge LORD} with thanksgiving;\\
\vin Sing praise upon the harp unto our God:\\
Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth,\\
\vin Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.\\
He giveth to the beast his food,\\
\vin And to the young ravens which cry.\\
He delighteth not in the strength of the horse:\\
\vin He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.\\
The {\hge LORD} taketh pleasure in them that fear him,\\*
\vin In those that hope in his mercy.
