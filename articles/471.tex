Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note\footnotetext{`The Burial of Sir John Moore at Corunna', Rev Charles Wolfe (1791 -- 1823). \cite{treasury}. Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore died of wounds having led his men into battle at Corunna, 1809.}\\*
\vin As his corpse to the rampart we hurried;\\
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot\\*
\vin O'er the grave where our hero we buried.\\!

We buried him darkly at dead of night,\\*
\vin The sods with our bayonets turning,\\
By the struggling moonbeam's misty light\\*
\vin And the lantern dimly burning.\\!

No useless coffin enclosed his breast,\\*
\vin Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;\\
But he lay like a warrior taking his rest\\*
\vin With his martial cloak around him.\\!

Few \& short were the prayers we said,\\*
\vin And we spoke not a word of sorrow;\\
But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,\\*
\vin And we bitterly thought of the morrow.\\!

We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed\\*
\vin And smoothed down his lonely pillow,\\
That the foe \& the stranger would tread o'er his head,\\*
\vin And we far away on the billow!\\!

Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,\\*
\vin And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him --\\
But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on\\*
\vin In the grave where a briton has laid him.\\!

But \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} of our heavy task was done\\*
\vin When the clock struck the hour for retiring;\\
And we heard the distant \& random gun\\*
\vin That the foe was sullenly firing.\\!

Slowly \& sadly we laid him down,\\*
\vin From the field of his fame fresh \& gory;\\
We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,\\*
\vin But we left him alone with his glory.
