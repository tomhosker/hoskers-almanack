\poemlines{5}
In the vaulted way, where the passage turned\footnotetext{Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin To the shadowy corner that none could see,\\
\vin You paused for our parting -- plaintively:\\
Though overnight had come words that burned\\*
\vin My fond frail happiness out of me.\\!

And then I kissed you -- despite my thought\\*
\vin That our spell must end when reflection came\\
\vin On what you had deemed me, whose one long aim\\
Had been to serve you; that what I sought\\*
\vin Lay not in a heart that could breathe such blame.\\!

But yet I kissed you: whereon you again\\*
\vin As of old kissed me. Why, why was it so?\\
\vin Do you cleave to me after that light-tongued blow?\\
If you scorned me at eventide, how love then?\\*
\vin The thing is dark, dear. I do not know.
