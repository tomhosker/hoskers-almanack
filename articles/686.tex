\poemlines{5}
In the black winter morning\footnotetext{Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{newlove}. \P Grey's Bridge is a bridge over the River Frome just outside of Dorchester, and Durnover Lea is a nearby meadow.}\\* 
\vin No light will be struck near my eyes\\
While the clock in the stairway is warning\\*
\vin For five, when he used to rise.\\!

{\it Leave the door unbarred,\\*
\vin The clock unwound;\\
Make my lone bed hard;\\*
\vin Would 'twere underground!}\\!

When the summer dawns clearly,\\*
\vin And the apple tree tops seem alight,\\
Who will undraw the curtain and cheerly\\*
\vin Call out that the morning is bright?\\!

When I tarry at market\\*
\vin No form will cross {\sc Durnover Lea}\\
In the gathering darkness, to hark at\\*
\vin {\sc Grey's Bridge} for the pit-pat o' me.\\!

When the supper crock's steaming,\\*
\vin And the time is the time of his tread,\\
I shall sit by the fire and wait dreaming\\*
\vin In a silence as of the dead.\\!

{\it Leave the door unbarred,\\*
\vin The clock unwound;\\
Make my lone bed hard;\\*
\vin Would 'twere underground!}\\!
