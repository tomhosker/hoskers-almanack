Does the road wind up-hill all the way?\footnotetext{`Up-Hill', Miss Christina Rossetti (1830 -- 1894). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Yes, to the very end.\\
Will the day's journey take the whole long day?\\*
\vin From morn to night, my friend.\\!

But is there for the night a resting-place?\\*
\vin A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.\\
May not the darkness hide it from my face?\\*
\vin You cannot miss that inn.\\!

Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?\\*
\vin Those who have gone before.\\
Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?\\*
\vin They will not keep you standing at that door.\\!

Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?\\*
\vin Of labour you shall find the sum.\\
Will there be beds for me and all who seek?\\*
\vin Yea, beds for all who come.
