\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
O the streams of lovely \emph{Nancy} divide in three parts,\footnotetext{`The Streams of Lovelt Nancy', Anon. \cite{rusby_awkward}. The origin and meaning of this beautiful song are as fascinating as they are obscure, but an educated guess seems to be that it was cobbled together in the West Country in the eighteenth century from a number of sailors' songs.}\\*
Oh, the streams of lovely Nancy are divided in three parts\\
It's the drinking of good liquor that makes my heart sing,\\*
And the noise in the valley makes the rocks for to ring.\\!

At the top of this mountain, my love's castle stands,\\*
It's all o'erbuilt with ivory on yonder black sands.\\
Fine arches, fine porches, and diamonds so bright:\\*
It's a beacon for a sailor on a dark winter's night.\\!

On yonder high mountain where the wild fowl do fly.\\*
There is one in amongst them that flies very high.\\
If I had her in my arms, near the diamond's black land\\*
How soon I would secure her by the sleight of my hand.\\!

At the base of this mountain a river runs clear.\\*
A ship from the Indies did once anchor there,\\
With her red flags a-flying, the beating of her drum,\\*
Sweet instruments of music and the firing of her gun.
