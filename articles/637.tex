Now that I've nearly done my days,\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `The Things that Matter', Mrs Edith Bland (1858 -- 1924). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. As often happens, Mrs Bland lived for another nineteen years after this poem was first published.}\\*
\vin And grown too stiff to sweep or sew,\\
I sit \& think, till I'm amaze,\\
\vin About what lots of things I know:\\
Things as I've found out one by one --\\
\vin And when Iâ€™m fast down in the clay,\\
My knowing things and how they're done\\*
\vin Will all be lost \& thrown away.\\!

There's things, I know, as won't be lost,\\*
\vin Things as folks write \& talk about:\\
The way to keep your roots from frost,\\
\vin And how to get your ink spots out.\\
What medicine's good for sores \& sprains,\\
\vin What way to salt your butter down,\\
What charms will cure your different pains,\\*
\vin And what will bright your faded gown.\\!

But more important things than these,\\*
\vin They can't be written in a book:\\
How fast to boil your greens \& peas,\\
\vin And how good bacon ought to look;\\
The feel of real good wearing stuff,\\
\vin The kind of apple as will keep,\\
The look of bread that's rose enough,\\*
\vin And how to get a child asleep.\\!

Whether the jam is fit to pot,\\*
\vin Whether the milk is going to turn,\\
Whether a hen will lay or not,\\
\vin Is things as some folks never learn.\\
I know the weather by the sky;\\
\vin I know what herbs grow in what lane;\\
And if sick men are going to die,\\*
\vin Or if they'll get about again.\\!

Young wives come in, a-smiling, grave,\\*
\vin With secrets that they itch to tell:\\
I know what sort of times they'll have,\\
\vin And if they'll have a boy or gell.\\
And if a lad is ill to bind,\\
\vin Or some young maid is hard to lead,\\
I know when you should speak 'em kind,\\*
\vin And when it's scolding as they need.\\!

I used to know where birds'd set,\\*
\vin And likely spots for trout or hare,\\
And God may want me to forget\\
\vin The way to set a line or snare;\\
But not the way to truss a chick,\\
\vin To fry a fish, or baste a roast,\\
Nor how to tell, when folks are sick,\\*
\vin What kind of herb will ease them most.\\!

Forgetting seems such silly waste.\\*
\vin I know so many little things,\\
And now the angels will make haste\\
\vin To dust it all away with wings.\\
O God, you made me like to know,\\
\vin You kept the things straight in my head,\\
Please God, if you can make it so,\\*
\vin Let me know something when I'm dead.
