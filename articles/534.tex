Why should you swear I am forsworn,\footnotetext{`The Scrutiny', Col Richard Lovelace (1617 -- 1657). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin Since thine I vowed to be?\\
Lady, it is already morn,\\
\vin And 'twas last night I swore to thee\\*
\vin That fond impossibility.\\!

Have I not loved thee much \& long,\\*
\vin A tedious 12 hours' space?\\
I must all other beauties wrong,\\
\vin And rob thee of a new embrace,\\*
\vin Could I still dote upon thy face.\\!

Not but all joy in thy brown hair\\*
\vin By others may be found;\\
But I must search the black \& fair,\\
\vin Like skilful mineralists that sound\\*
\vin For treasure in unploughed-up ground.\\!

Then if, when I have loved my round,\\*
\vin Thou prov'st the pleasant she,\\
With spoils of meaner beauties crowned\\
\vin I laden will return to thee,\\*
\vin Ev'n sated with variety.
