\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
Two separate divided silences,\footnotetext{Gabriel Rossetti (1828 -- 1882). \cite{newlove}. This sonnet is from Rossetti's sequence, \emph{The House of Life}.}\\*
\vin Which, brought together, would find loving voice;\\
\vin Two glances which together would rejoice\\
In love, now lost like stars beyond dark trees;\\
Two hands apart whose touch alone gives ease;\\
\vin Two bosoms which, heart-shrined with mutual flame,\\
\vin Would, meeting in one clasp, be made the same;\\
Two souls, the shore wave-mocked of sundering seas:\\
Such are we now. Ah may our hope forecast\\
\vin Indeed one hour again, when on this stream\\
\vin Of darkened love once more the light shall gleam?\\
An hour how slow to come -- how quickly past --\\
Which blooms \& fades, and only leaves at last,\\*
\vin Faint as shed flowers, the attenuated dream.
\end{verse}
