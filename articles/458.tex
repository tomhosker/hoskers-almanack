Control of the passes was, he saw, the key\footnotetext{`The Secret Agent', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
To this new district, but who would get it?\\
He, the trained spy, had walked into the trap\\*
For a bogus guide, seduced with the old tricks.\\!

At {\sc Greenhearth} was a fine site for a dam\\*
And easy power, had they pushed the rail\\
Some stations nearer. They ignored his wires.\\*
The bridges were unbuilt and trouble coming.\\!

The street music seemed gracious now to one\\*
For weeks up in the desert. Woken by water\\
Running away in the dark, he often had\\
Reproached the night for a companion\\
Dreamed of already. They would shoot, of course,\\*
Parting easily who were never joined.
