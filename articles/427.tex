Go \& catch a falling star;\footnotetext{Very Rev Dr John Donne (1573 -- 1631). \cite{norton}. \P The line about the `mandrake root' is puzzling. Surely it should be, ``Get with child \emph{by} mandrake root'' since mandrakes were once believed to have aphrodisiac and fertilising qualities (as per Genesis 30), an old wives' tale similar to the legends about Ulysses and the sirens or, indeed, a faithful beautiful woman? Or is the Very Rev Dr Donne genuinely inviting the reader to ejaculate into a plant?}\\*
\vin Get with child a mandrake root;\\
Tell me where all past years are,\\
\vin Or who cleft the devil's foot;\\
Teach me to hear mermaids singing,\\
Or to keep off envy's stinging,\\
\vin \vin And find\\
\vin \vin What wind\\*
Serves to advance an honest mind.\\!

If thou be'st born to strange sights,\\*
\vin Things invisible to see,\\
Ride 10,000 days \& nights,\\
\vin Till age snow white hairs on thee;\\
Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,\\
All strange wonders that befell thee,\\
\vin \vin And swear:\\
\vin \vin Nowhere\\*
Lives a woman true, and fair.\\!

If thou find'st one, let me know;\\*
\vin Such a pilgrimage were sweet;\\
Yet do not; I would not go,\\
\vin Though at next door we might meet;\\
Though she were true when you met her,\\
And last till you write your letter,\\
\vin \vin Yet she\\
\vin \vin Will be\\*
False, ere I come, to two, or three.
