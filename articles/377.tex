Whose woods these are I think I know.\footnotetext{`Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening', Robert Frost, Poet Laureate of the United States, Poet Laureate of Vermont (1874 -- 1963). \cite{norton}.}\\*
His house is in the village though;\\
He will not see me stopping here\\*
To watch his woods fill up with snow.\\!

My little horse must think it queer\\*
To stop without a farmhouse near\\
Between the woods \& frozen lake\\*
The darkest evening of the year.\\!

He gives his harness bells a shake\\*
To ask if there is some mistake.\\
The only other sound's the sweep\\*
Of easy wind \& downy flake.\\!

The woods are lovely, dark \& deep,\\*
But I have promises to keep,\\
And miles to go before I sleep,\\*
And miles to go before I sleep.
\end{verse}
