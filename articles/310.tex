\poemlines{5}
O Lord, thou hast searched me out \& known me;\footnotetext{Psalm 139. \cite{bcp}. \P `Then shall my night be turned to day' seems to be a mistranslation; the full couplet ought to read something like, `If I say, ``Let only darkness cover me,/ And the light about me be night...{''}' (This at least is how the RSV renders it.) \P The Almanackist has deleted the couplet immediately following `And in thy book were all my members written.'}\\*
\vin Thou knowest my down-sitting \& mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.\\
Thou art about my path, \& about my bed,\\
\vin And spiest out all my ways.\\
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue,\\
\vin But thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.\\
Thou hast fashioned me behind \& before,\\
\vin And laid thine hand upon me.\\
Such knowledge is too wonderful \& excellent for me;\\
\vin I cannot attain unto it.\\!

Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit?\\*
\vin Or whither shall I go then from thy presence?\\
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there;\\
\vin If I go down to hell, thou art there also.\\
If I take the wings of the morning,\\
\vin And remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;\\
Even there also shall thy hand lead me,\\
\vin And thy right hand shall hold me.\\
If I say, `Peradventure the darkness shall cover me,'\\
\vin Then shall my night be turned to day.\\
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day;\\
\vin The darkness \& light to thee are both alike.\\
For my reins are thine;\\
\vin Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.\\
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;\\
\vin Marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.\\
My bones are not hid from thee,\\
\vin Though I be made secretly, and fashioned beneath in the earth.\\
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect,\\*
\vin And in thy book were all my members written.\\!

How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God!\\*
\vin O how great is the sum of them!\\
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand;\\*
\vin When I wake up I am present with thee.\\!

Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God?\\*
\vin Depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.\\
For they speak unrighteously against thee,\\
\vin And thine enemies take thy Name in vain.\\
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee?\\
\vin And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?\\
Yea, I hate them right sore,\\
\vin Even as though they were mine enemies.\\
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart;\\
\vin Prove me, and examine my thoughts.\\
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me,\\*
\vin And lead me in the way everlasting.
