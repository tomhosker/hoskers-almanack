`Is there anybody there?' said the traveller,\footnotetext{`The Listeners', Walter de la Mare (1873 -- 1956). \cite{norton}. This poem was said to be a favourite of St Teresa of Calcutta.}\\*
\vin Knocking on the moonlit door;\\
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses\\
\vin Of the forest's ferny floor:\\
And a bird flew up out of the turret,\\
\vin Above the traveller's head:\\
And he smote upon the door again a second time;\\
\vin `Is there anybody there?' he said.\\
But no one descended to the traveller;\\
\vin No head from the leaf-fringed sill\\
Leaned over \& looked into his grey eyes,\\
\vin Where he stood perplexed \& still.\\
But only a host of phantom listeners\\
\vin That dwelt in the lone house then\\
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight\\
\vin To that voice from the world of men:\\
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,\\
\vin That goes down to the empty hall,\\
Hearkening in an air stirred \& shaken\\
\vin By the lonely traveller's call.\\
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,\\
\vin Their stillness answering his cry,\\
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,\\
\vin 'Neath the starred \& leafy sky;\\
For he suddenly smote on the door, even\\
\vin Louder, and lifted his head:\\
`Tell them I came, and no one answered,\\
\vin That I kept my word,' he said.\\
Never the least stir made the listeners,\\
\vin Though every word he spake\\
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house\\
\vin From the one man left awake:\\
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,\\
\vin And the sound of iron on stone,\\
And how the silence surged softly backward,\\*
\vin When the plunging hoofs were gone.
