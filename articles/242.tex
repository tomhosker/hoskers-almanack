\poemlines{5}
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,\footnotetext{William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616) \cite{shakespeare}. These famous lines are uttered by Prospero in \emph{The Tempest} IV.1. The Almanackist has excised two lines after `Sir, I am vexed...'}\\*
As I foretold you, were all spirits and\\
Are melted into air, into thin air:\\
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\\
The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\\
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\\
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve\\
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\\
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\\
As dreams are made on, and our little life\\
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed...\\
If you be pleased, retire into my cell\\
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,\\*
To still my beating mind.
