When thou \& I are dead, my dear,\footnotetext{`Inseparable', Philip Marston (1850 -- 1937). \cite{newlove}. Other sources give the first line as `When I and thou are dead, my dearest'.}\\*
\vin The earth above us lain,\\
When we no more in autumn hear\\
\vin The fall of leaves \& rain,\\
Or round the snow-enshrouded year\\*
\vin The midnight winds complain;\\!

When we no more in green mid-spring,\\*
\vin Its sights \& sounds may mind;\\
The warm wet leaves set quivering\\
\vin With touches of the wind,\\
The birds at morn, \& birds that sing\\*
\vin When day is left behind;\\!

When over all the moonlight lies,\\*
\vin Intensely bright \& still;\\
When some meandering brooklet sighs,\\
\vin At parting from its hill;\\
And scents from voiceless gardens rise,\\*
\vin The peaceful air to fill;\\!

When we no more through summer light\\*
\vin The deep, dim woods discern,\\
Nor hear the nightingales at night,\\
\vin In vehement singing, yearn\\
To stars \& moon, that, dumb \& bright,\\*
\vin In nightly vigil burn;\\!

When smiles, \& hopes, \& joys, and fears,\\*
\vin And words that lovers say,\\
And sighs of love, \& passionate tears\\
\vin Are lost to us for aye,\\
What thing of all our love appears,\\*
\vin In cold \& coffined clay?\\!

When all their kisses, sweet \& close,\\*
\vin Our lips shall quite forget;\\
When, where the day upon us rose,\\
\vin The day shall rise \& set,\\
While we for love's sublime repose\\*
\vin Shall have not one regret;\\!

O this true comfort is, I think,\\*
\vin That, be death near or far,\\
When we have crossed the fatal brink,\\
\vin And found nor moon nor star --\\
To know not, when in death we sink,\\*
\vin The lifeless things we are.\\!

Yet one thought is, I deem, more kind,\\*
\vin That when we sleep so well,\\
On memories that we leave behind,\\
\vin When kindred spirits dwell,\\
My name to thine in words they'll bind\\*
\vin Of love inseparable.
