In a coign of the cliff between lowland \& highland,\footnotetext{`A Forsaken Garden', Algernon Swinburne (1837 -- 1909). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
\vin At the sea-down's edge between windward \& lee,\\ 
Walled round with rocks as an inland island,\\
\vin The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.\\
A girdle of brushwood \& thorn encloses\\ 
\vin The steep square slope of the blossomless bed\\ 
Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses\\*
\vin \vin \vin Now lie dead.\\!

The fields fall southward, abrupt \& broken,\\*
\vin To the low last edge of the long lone land.\\
If a step should sound or a word be spoken,\\
\vin Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand?\\ 
So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless,\\
\vin Through branches \& briars if a man make way,\\
He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless\\* 
\vin \vin \vin Night \& day.\\!

The dense hard passage is blind \& stifled\\*
\vin That crawls by a track none turn to climb\\
To the strait waste place that the years have rifled\\
\vin Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time.\\
The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;\\
\vin The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.\\
The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,\\*
\vin \vin \vin These remain.\\!

Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;\\*
\vin As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;\\
From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,\\
\vin Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.\\
Over the meadows that blossom \& wither\\
\vin Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song;\\
Only the sun \& the rain come hither\\*
\vin \vin \vin All year long.\\!

The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels\\*
\vin One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.\\ 
Only the wind here hovers \& revels\\
\vin In a round where life seems barren as death.\\
Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,\\
\vin Haply, of lovers none ever will know,\\
Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping\\*
\vin \vin \vin Years ago.\\!

Heart handfast in heart as they stood, `Look thither,'\\*
\vin Did he whisper? 'Look forth from the flowers to the sea;\\ 
For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,\\ 
\vin And men that love lightly may die -- but we?'\\
And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,\\
\vin And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,\\
In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,\\*
\vin \vin \vin Love was dead.\\!

Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?\\*
\vin And were one to the endâ€”but what end who knows?\\
Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,\\
\vin As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose.\\
Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?\\
\vin What love was ever as deep as a grave?\\
They are loveless now as the grass above them\\*
\vin \vin \vin Or the wave.\\!

All are at one now, roses \& lovers,\\*
\vin Not known of the cliffs \& the fields \& the sea.\\
Not a breath of the time that has been hovers\\
\vin In the air now soft with a summer to be.\\
Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter\\
\vin Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep,\\
When as they that are free now of weeping \& laughter\\*
\vin \vin \vin We shall sleep.\\!

Here death may deal not again for ever;\\*
\vin Here change may come not till all change end.\\
From the graves they have made they shall rise up never,\\
\vin Who have left nought living to ravage \& rend.\\
Earth, stones, \& thorns of the wild ground growing,\\
\vin While the sun \& the rain live, these shall be;\\
Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing\\*
\vin \vin \vin Roll the sea.\\!

Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,\\*
\vin Till terrace \& meadow the deep gulfs drink,\\
Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble\\
\vin The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,\\
Here now in his triumph where all things falter,\\
\vin Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,\\
As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,\\*
\vin \vin \vin Death lies dead.
