Ye living lamps, by whose dear light\footnotetext{`The Mower to the Glowworms', Andrew Marvell (1621 -- 1678). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin The nightingale does sit so late,\\
And studying all the summer night,\\*
\vin Her matchless songs does meditate;\\!

Ye country comets, that portend\\*
\vin No war nor prince's funeral,\\
Shining unto no higher end\\
\vin Than to presage the grass's fall;\\!

Ye glow-worms, whose officious flame\\*
\vin To wand'ring mowers shows the way,\\
That in the night have lost their aim,\\*
\vin And after foolish fires do stray;\\!

Your courteous lights in vain you waste,\\*
\vin Since \emph{Juliana} here is come,\\
For she my mind hath so displaced\\*
\vin That I shall never find my home.
\end{verse}
