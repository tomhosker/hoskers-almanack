It was too lonely for her there,\footnotetext{`The Impulse', Robert Frost, Poet Laureate of the United States, Poet Laureate of Vermont (1874 -- 1963). \cite{norton}. This is part of a sequence of poems called `The Hill Wife'.}\\*
\vin And too wild,\\
And since there were but two of them,\\*
\vin And no child,\\!

And work was little in the house,\\*
\vin She was free,\\
And followed where he furrowed field,\\*
\vin Or felled tree.\\!

She rested on a log and tossed\\*
\vin The fresh chips,\\
With a song only to herself\\*
\vin On her lips.\\!

And once she went to break a bough\\*
\vin Of black alder.\\
She strayed so far she scarcely heard\\*
\vin When he called her --\\!

And didn't answer -- didn't speak --\\*
\vin Or return.\\
She stood, and then she ran \& hid\\*
\vin In the fern.\\!

He never found her, though he looked\\*
\vin Everywhere,\\
And he asked at her mother's house\\*
\vin Was she there.\\!

Sudden \& swift \& light as that\\*
\vin The ties gave,\\
And he learned of finalities\\*
\vin Besides the grave.
