Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more\footnotetext{`Lycidas', John Milton (1608 -- 1674). \cite{treasury}. In his \emph{Poems} of 1645, Milton gave this preface: `In this monody the author bewails a learned friend [Edward King], unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish seas, 1637. And by occasion foretells the ruin of our corrupted clergy, then in their height.'}\\*
Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,\\
I come to pluck your berries harsh \& crude,\\
And with forced fingers rude\\
Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.\\
Bitter constraint \& sad occasion dear\\
Compels me to disturb your season due;\\
For \emph{Lycidas} is dead, dead ere his prime,\\
Young \emph{Lycidas}, and hath not left his peer.\\
Who would not sing for \emph{Lycidas}? he knew\\
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.\\
He must not float upon his watery bier\\
Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,\\*
Without the meed of some melodious tear.\\!

Begin then, sisters of the sacred well\\*
That from beneath the seat of \emph{Jove} doth spring;\\
Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string.\\
Hence with denial vain \& coy excuse!\\
So may some gentle muse\\
With lucky words favour my destined urn,\\
And as he passes turn\\*
And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.\\!

For we were nursed upon the selfsame hill,\\*
Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, \& rill;\\
Together both, ere the high lawns appeared\\
Under the opening eyelids of the morn,\\
We drove afield, and both together heard\\
What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn,\\
Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,\\
Oft till the star that rose at evening bright\\
Toward heav'n's descent had sloped his westering wheel.\\
Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,\\
Tempered to th'oaten flute;\\
Rough satyrs danced, \& fauns with cloven heel,\\
From the glad sound would not be absent long;\\*
And old \emph{Damoetas} loved to hear our song.\\!

But O the heavy change now thou art gone,\\*
Now thou art gone, and never must return.\\
Thee, shepherd, thee the woods \& desert caves,\\
With wild thyme \& the gadding vine o'ergrown,\\
And all their echoes mourn.\\
The willows \& the hazel copses green\\
Shall now no more be seen\\
Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.\\
As killing as the canker to the rose,\\
Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,\\
Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear\\
When first the white thorn blows:\\*
Such, \emph{Lycidas}, thy loss to shepherd's ear.\\!

Where were ye, nymphs, when the remorseless deep\\*
Closed o'er the head of your loved \emph{Lycidas}?\\
For neither were ye playing on the steep\\
Where your old bards, the famous druids, lie,\\
Nor on the shaggy top of {\sc Mona} high,\\
Nor yet where {\sc Deva} spreads her wizard stream.\\
Aye me! I fondly dream\\
Had ye been there -- for what could that have done?\\
What could the muse herself that \emph{Orpheus} bore,\\
The muse herself, for her enchanting son,\\
Whom universal nature did lament,\\
When by the rout that made the hideous roar\\
His gory visage down the stream was sent,\\*
Down the swift {\sc Hebrus} to the lesbian shore?\\!

Alas! what boots it with incessant care\\*
To tend the homely, slighted shepherd's trade,\\
And strictly meditate the thankless muse?\\
Were it not better done, as others use,\\
To sport with \emph{Amaryllis} in the shade,\\
Or with the tangles of \emph{Neaera}'s hair?\\
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise\\
(That last infirmity of noble mind)\\
To scorn delights \& live laborious days;\\
But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,\\
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,\\
Comes the blind fury with th'abhorred shears,\\
And slits the thin-spun life. `But not the praise,'\\
\emph{Phoebus} replied, and touched my trembling ears;\\
`Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,\\
Nor in the glistering foil\\
Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies,\\
But lives \& spreads aloft by those pure eyes\\
And perfect witness of all-judging \emph{Jove};\\
As he pronounces lastly on each deed,\\*
Of so much fame in heav'n expect thy meed.'\\!

O fountain {\sc Arethuse}, and thou honoured flood,\\*
Smooth-sliding {\sc Mincius}, crowned with vocal reeds,\\
That strain I heard was of a higher mood.\\
But now my oat proceeds,\\
And listens to the herald of the sea,\\
That came in \emph{Neptune}'s plea.\\
He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,\\
`What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?'\\
And questioned every gust of rugged wings\\
That blows from off each beaked promontory.\\
They knew not of his story;\\
And sage \emph{Hippotades} their answer brings,\\
That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed;\\
The air was calm, and on the level brine\\
Sleek \emph{Panope} with all her sisters played.\\
It was that fatal \& perfidious bark,\\
Built in th'eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,\\*
That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.\\!

Next \emph{Camus}, reverend sire, went footing slow,\\*
His mantle hairy, \& his bonnet sedge,\\
Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge\\
Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.\\
`Ah! who hath reft,' quoth he, `my dearest pledge?'\\
Last came, and last did go,\\
The pilot of the galilean lake;\\
Two massy keys he bore of metals twain\\
(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain).\\
He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:\\
`How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,\\
Enow of such as for their bellies' sake\\
Creep \& intrude, and climb into the fold?\\
Of other care they little reckoning make\\
Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast\\
And shove away the worthy bidden guest.\\
Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold\\
A sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least\\
That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!\\
What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;\\
And when they list their lean \& flashy songs\\
Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw,\\
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,\\
But, swoll'n with wind \& the rank mist they draw,\\
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread;\\
Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw\\
Daily devours apace, and nothing said,\\
But that two-handed engine at the door\\*
Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.'\\!

Return, \emph{Alpheus}: the dread voice is past\\*
That shrunk thy streams; return, sicilian muse,\\
And call the vales \& bid them hither cast\\
Their bells \& flowerets of 1000 hues.\\
Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use\\
Of shades \& wanton winds, \& gushing brooks,\\
On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks,\\
Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes,\\
That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers\\
And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.\\
Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,\\
The tufted crow-toe, \& pale jessamine,\\
The white pink, \& the pansy freaked with jet,\\
The glowing violet,\\
The musk-rose, \& the well attired woodbine,\\
With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,\\
And every flower that sad embroidery wears;\\
Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed,\\
And daffadillies fill their cups with tears,\\
To strew the laureate hearse where \emph{Lycid} lies.\\
For so to interpose a little ease,\\
Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.\\
Aye me! Whilst thee the shores \& sounding seas\\
Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled;\\
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,\\
Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide\\
Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world,\\
Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,\\
Sleep'st by the fable of \emph{Bellerus} old,\\
Where the great vision of the guarded mount\\
Looks toward {\sc Namancos} \& {\sc Bayona}'s hold:\\
Look homeward angel now, and melt with ruth;\\*
And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth.\\!

Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,\\*
For \emph{Lycidas}, your sorrow, is not dead,\\
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor;\\
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,\\
And yet anon repairs his drooping head,\\
And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore\\
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:\\
So \emph{Lycidas} sunk low, but mounted high\\
Through the dear might of him that walked the waves;\\
Where, other groves \& other streams along,\\
With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,\\
And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,\\
In the blest kingdoms meek of joy \& love.\\
There entertain him all the saints above,\\
In solemn troops, \& sweet societies,\\
That sing, and singing in their glory move,\\
And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.\\
Now, \emph{Lycidas}, the shepherds weep no more:\\
Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore,\\
In thy large recompense, and shalt be good\\*
To all that wander in that perilous flood.\\!

Thus sang the uncouth swain to th'oaks \& rills,\\*
While the still morn went out with sandals gray;\\
He touched the tender stops of various quills,\\
With eager thought warbling his doric lay;\\
And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,\\
And now was dropped into the western bay;\\
At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue:\\*
Tomorrow to fresh woods, \& pastures new.
