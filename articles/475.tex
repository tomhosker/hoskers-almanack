\poemlines{5}
Perfection, of a kind, was what he was after,\footnotetext{`Epitaph on a Tyrant', \S 3, Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
And the poetry he invented was easy to understand;\\
He knew human folly like the back of his hand,\\
As was greatly interested in armies \& fleets;\\
When he laughed, respectable senators burst with laughter,\\*
And when he cried the little children died in the streets.
