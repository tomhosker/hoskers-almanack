\poemlines{5}
The heavens declare the glory of God,\footnotetext{Psalm 19. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin And the firmament sheweth his handywork.\\
One day telleth another,\\
\vin And one night certifieth another.\\
There is neither speech nor language,\\
\vin But their voices are heard among them.\\
Their sound is gone out into all lands,\\
\vin And their words into the ends of the world.\\
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,\\
\vin Which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.\\
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the end of it again,\\*
\vin And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.\\!

The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul;\\*
\vin The testimony of the Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.\\
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart;\\
\vin The commandment of the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.\\
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever;\\
\vin The judgements of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.\\
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold,\\*
\vin Sweeter also than honey, and the honey-comb.
