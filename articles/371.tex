Here she lies, a pretty bud,\footnotetext{`Upon a Child that Died', Rev Robert Herrick (1591 -- 1674). \cite{norton}. This little poem was clearly influenced by Ben Jonson's `On My First Daughter'.}\\*
Lately made of flesh \& blood,\\
Who as soon fell fast asleep\\
As her little eyes did peep.\\
Give her strewings, but not stir\\*
The earth that lightly covers her.
\end{verse}
