Tell me no more how fair she is.\footnotetext{$\xi$ Rt Rev Dr Henry King, Bishop of Chichester (1592 -- 1669). \cite{obev}.}\\*
\vin I have no mind to hear\\
The story of that distant bliss\\
\vin I never shall come near:\\
By sad experience I have found\\*
That her perfection is my wound.\\!

And tell me not how fond I am\\*
\vin To tempt a daring fate,\\
From whence no triumph ever came,\\
\vin But to repent too late:\\
There is some hope ere long I may\\*
In silence dote my self away.\\!

I ask no pity, love, from thee,\\*
\vin Nor will thy justice blame,\\
So that thou wilt not envy me\\
\vin The glory of my flame:\\
Which crowns my heart when ere it dies,\\*
In that it falls her sacrifice.
