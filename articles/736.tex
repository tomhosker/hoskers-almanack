\poemlines{5}
She should have died hereafter;\footnotetext{$\xi$ William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{obev}. These lines form the eponymous villain's lament for his wife from \emph{Macbeth} V.5.}\\*
There would have been a time for such a word.\\
Tomorrow \& tomorrow \& tomorrow,\\
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day\\
To the last syllable of recorded time,\\
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\\
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\\
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player\\
That struts \& frets his hour upon the stage\\
And then is heard no more: it is a tale\\
Told by an idiot, full of sound \& fury,\\
Signifying nothing.
\end{verse}
