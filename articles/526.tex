The waves, like ridges of ploughed land, are high;\footnotetext{`The Sea Similised to Meadows and Pastures: the Mariners, to Shepherds: the Mast, to a May-Pole: the Fish, to Beasts', Margaret Cavendish, Duchess, Marchioness and Countess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Viscountess Mansfield and Baroness Ogle (1623 -- 1673). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Whereat the ship oft stumbling, down doth lie.\\
But, in a calm, the sea's like meadows seen\\
Level; its saltness makes it look as green.\\
When ships thereon a slow soft pace do walk;\\
Then mariners, as shepherds, sing \& talk:\\
Some whistle, and some on their pipes do play;\\
And thus, with mirth, they pass their time away.\\
And every mast is like a may-pole high,\\
Round which they dance, though not so merrily\\
As shepherds do, when they their lasses bring\\
Garlands, to may-poles tied with a silk string.\\
Instead of garlands, they hang on their mast\\
Huge sails \& ropes, to tie these garlands fast.\\
Instead of lasses, they do dance with death;\\
And for their music, they have \emph{Boreas}' breath.\\
Instead of wine \& wassails, drink salt tears;\\
And for their meat, they feed on nought but fears.\\
For flocks of sheep, great schools of herrings swim;\\
The whales, as ravenous wolves, do feed on them.\\
As sportful kids skip over hillocks green,\\
So dancing dolphins, on the waves are seen.\\
The porpoise, like their watchful dogs espies,\\
And gives them warning when great winds will rise.\\
Instead of barking, he his head doth show\\
Above the waters, when they roughly flow:\\
And, like as men, in time of showering rain\\
And wind, do not in open fields remain;\\
But quickly run for shelter to a tree:\\
So ships at anchor lie upon the sea.
