\poemlines{5}
Ladies \& gentlemen, you have made most remarkable\footnotetext{`Recitative by Death', Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
\vin Progress, and progress, I agree, is a boon;\\
You have built more automobiles than are parkable,\\
\vin Crashed the sound-barrier, and may very soon\\
\vin Be setting up juke-boxes on the moon:\\
But I beg to remind you that, despite all that,\\*
I, death, am \& will always be cosmocrat.\\!

Still I sport with the young \& daring; at my whim\\*
\vin The climber steps upon the rotten boulder;\\
The undertow catches boys as they swim;\\
\vin The speeder steers onto the slippery shoulder:\\
\vin With others I wait until they are older,\\
Before assigning, according to my humour,\\*
To one a coronary, to another a tumour.\\!

Liberal my views on religion \& race;\\
Tax-posture, credit-rating, social ambition\\
Cut no ice with me. We shall meet face to face\\
\vin Despite the drugs \& lies of your physician,\\
\vin The costly euphemisms of the mortician:\\
{\sc Westchester} matron and {\sc Bowery} bum,\\*
Both shall dance with me when I rattle my drum.
