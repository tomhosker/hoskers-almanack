The miller's wife had waited long;\footnotetext{`The Mill', Edwin Robinson (1869 -- 1935). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin The tea was cold; the fire was dead;\\
And there might yet be nothing wrong\\
\vin In how he went \& what he said:\\
`There are no millers any more,'\\
\vin Was all that she had heard him say;\\
And he had lingered at the door\\*
\vin So long that it seemed yesterday.\\!

Sick with a fear that had no form\\*
\vin She knew that she was there at last;\\
And in the mill there was a warm\\
\vin And mealy fragrance of the past.\\
What else there was would only seem\\
\vin To say again what he had meant;\\
And what was hanging from a beam\\*
\vin Would not have heeded where she went.\\!

And if she thought it followed her,\\*
\vin She may have reasoned in the dark\\
That one way of the few there were\\
\vin Would hide her \& would leave no mark:\\
Black water, smooth above the weir\\
\vin Like starry velvet in the night,\\
Though ruffled once, would soon appear\\*
\vin The same as ever to the sight.
