\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
As I was a-travelling in the north country,\footnotetext{William Graham (1830-1891). \cite{rusby_tgwcf}. Graham remains a minor folk hero in Cumberland; a poacher, he was transported to Australia for killing a gamekeeper. The attribution of the song to Graham is uncertain.}\\*
Down by {\sc Kirkby Stephen} I happened for to be,\\
As I was a-walking up \& down the street,\\*
A pretty little buy-a-broom I chanc\`ed for to meet.\\!

{\it And she was right; I was tight; everybody has their way.\\*
It was the lish young buy-a-broom that led me astray.}\\!

She kindly then invited me to go along the way.\\*
Yes was the answer to her that I did say.\\
There was me with my music walking down the street,\\*
And her with her tambourine was beating hand \& feet.\\!

Straightway for {\sc Kendal} we steer\`ed, her \& I;\\*
Over yon white mountain, the weather it was dry.\\
We each had a bottle filled up to the top,\\*
And whenever we were feeling dry, we took a little drop.\\!

The night's coming on, good lodgings we did find,\\*
Eatables of all sorts \& plenty of good wine,\\
Good bed \& blankets just for we two.\\*
And I rolled her in my arms, my boys, and wouldn't you do too?\\!

Well early the next morning we arose to go away.\\*
I called to the landlord to see what was to pay:\\
`Fourteen and sixpence, just for you two.'\\*
And a fiver on the table O my darling then she threw.\\!

Now the reason that we parted, I now will let you hear.\\*
She started off for Germany right early the next year;\\
And me not being willing to cross the raging sea...\\*
Here's a health to my buy-a-broom, wherever she may be.\\!

{\it And she was right; I was tight; everybody has their way.\\*
It was the lish young buy-a-broom that led me astray.}
