\poemlines{5}
I wonder whether the girls are mad,\footnotetext{$\dagger$ `William Bond', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\* 
\vin And I wonder whether they mean to kill,\\
And I wonder if \emph{William Bond} will die,\\*
\vin For assuredly he is very ill.\\!

He went to church in a may morning,\\*
\vin Attended by fairies, one, two \& three;\\
But the angels of providence drove them away,\\*
\vin And he returned home in misery.\\!

He went not out to the field nor fold,\\*
\vin He went not out to the village nor town,\\
But he came home in a black, black cloud,\\*
\vin And took to his bed \& there lay down.\\!

And an angel of providence at his feet,\\*
\vin And an angel of providence at his head,\\
And in the midst a black, black cloud,\\*
\vin And in the midst the sick man on his bed.\\!

And on his right hand was \emph{Mary Green},\\*
\vin And on his left hand was his sister \emph{Jane},\\
And their tears fell through the black, black cloud\\*
\vin To drive away the sick man's pain.\\!

`O \emph{William}, if thou dost another love,\\*
\vin Dost another love better than poor \emph{Mary},\\
Go \& take that other to be thy wife,\\*
\vin And \emph{Mary Green} shall her servant be.'\\!

`Yes, \emph{Mary}, I do another love,\\*
\vin Another I love far better than thee,\\
And another I will have for my wife;\\*
\vin Then what have I to do with thee?\\!

`For thou art melancholy pale,\\*
\vin And on thy head is the cold moon's shine,\\
But she is ruddy \& bright as day,\\*
\vin And the sunbeams dazzle from her eyne.'\\!

\emph{Mary} trembled \& \emph{Mary} chilled,\\*
\vin And \emph{Mary} fell down on the right-hand floor,\\
That \emph{William Bond} \& his sister \emph{Jane}\\*
\vin Scarce could recover \emph{Mary} more.\\!

When \emph{Mary} woke \& found her laid\\*
\vin On the right hand of her \emph{William} dear,\\
On the right hand of his loved bed,\\*
\vin And saw her \emph{William Bond} so near,\\!

The fairies that fled from \emph{William Bond}\\*
\vin Danc`ed around her shining head;\\
They danc`ed over the pillow white,\\*
\vin And the angels of providence left the bed.\\!

I thought love lived in the hot sunshine,\\*
\vin But O he lives in the moony light!\\
I thought to find love in the heat of day,\\*
\vin But sweet love is the comforter of night.\\!

Seek love in the pity of others' woe,\\*
\vin In the gentle relief of another's care,\\
In the darkness of night and the winter's snow;\\*
\vin In the naked \& outcast, seek love there!
