\poemlines{5}
Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness;\footnotetext{Psalm 51. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin According to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.\\
Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness,\\
\vin And cleanse me from my sin.\\
For I acknowledge my faults,\\
\vin And my sin is ever before me.\\
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight,\\
\vin That thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.\\
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness,\\
\vin And in sin hath my mother conceived me.\\
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts,\\
\vin And shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly.\\
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;\\
\vin Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\\
Thou shalt make me hear of joy \& gladness,\\
\vin That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.\\
Turn thy face from my sins,\\
\vin And put out all my misdeeds.\\
Make me a clean heart, O God,\\
\vin And renew a right spirit within me.\\
Cast me not away from thy presence,\\
\vin And take not thy Holy Spirit from me.\\
O give me the comfort of thy help again,\\
\vin And stablish me with thy free Spirit.\\
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked,\\
\vin And sinners shall be converted unto thee.\\
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health,\\
\vin And my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.\\
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord,\\
\vin And my mouth shall shew thy praise.\\
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee,\\
\vin But thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.\\
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit;\\*
\vin A broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.
