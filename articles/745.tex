We who are left, how shall we look again\footnotetext{`Lament', Wilfrid Gibson (1878 -- 1962). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. Although Gibson joined the British Army during the First World War, he never served abroad. Due to some kind of medical defect, possibly poor eyesight, he ultimately served as a clerk, which -- when one compares his lifespan to that of Edward Thomas, who was born in the same year -- turned out to be a good career move.}\\*
Happily on the sun or feel the rain\\
\vin Without remembering how they who went\\
\vin Ungrudgingly and spent\\*
Their lives for us loved, too, the sun \& rain?\\!

A bird among the rain-wet lilac sings --\\
But we, how shall we turn to little things\\
\vin And listen to the birds \& winds \& streams\\
\vin Made holy by their dreams,\\*
Nor feel the heart-break in the heart of things?
