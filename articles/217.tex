I saw eternity the other night,\footnotetext{`The World', Dr Henry Vaughan (1621 -- 1695). \cite{norton}. Dr Vaughan affixed a quotation from John's Gospel (2.16-17) to the end of this poem.}\\*
Like a great ring of pure and endless light,\\
\vin All calm, as it was bright;\\
And round beneath it, time in hours, days, years,\\
\vin Driven by the spheres\\
Like a vast shadow moved; in which the world\\
\vin And all her train were hurled.\\
The doting lover in his quaintest strain\\
\vin Did there complain;\\
Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights,\\
\vin Wit's sour delights,\\
With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure,\\
\vin Yet his dear treasure\\
All scattered lay, while he his eyes did pour\\*
\vin Upon a flower.\\!

The darksome statesman hung with weights \& woe,\\*
Like a thick midnight-fog moved there so slow,\\
\vin He did not stay, nor go;\\
Condemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) scowl\\
\vin Upon his soul,\\
And clouds of crying witnesses without\\
\vin Pursued him with one shout.\\
Yet digged the mole, and lest his ways be found,\\
\vin Worked under ground,\\
Where he did clutch his prey; but one did see\\
\vin That policy;\\
Churches \& altars fed him; perjuries\\
\vin Were gnats \& flies;\\
It rained about him blood and tears, but he\\*
\vin Drank them as free.\\!

The fearful miser on a heap of rust\\*
Sate pining all his life there, did scarce trust\\
\vin His own hands with the dust,\\
Yet would not place one piece above, but lives\\
\vin In fear of thieves;\\
Thousands there were as frantic as himself,\\
\vin And hugged each one his pelf;\\
The downright epicure placed heaven in sense,\\
\vin And scorned pretence,\\
While others, slipped into a wide excess,\\
\vin Said little less;\\
The weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave,\\
\vin Who think them brave;\\
And poor despised truth sate counting by\\*
\vin Their victory.\\!

Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing,\\*
And sing, and weep, soar'd up into the ring;\\
\vin But most would use no wing.\\
O fools (said I) thus to prefer dark night\\
\vin Before true light,\\
To live in grots \& caves, and hate the day\\
\vin Because it shows the way,\\
The way, which from this dead \& dark abode\\
\vin Leads up to God,\\
A way where you might tread the sun, and be\\
\vin More bright than he.\\
But as I did their madness so discuss\\
\vin One whispered thus,\\
`This ring the Bridegroom did for none provide,\\*
\vin But for his bride.'\\!
