\poemlines{5}
The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness\marginnote{$\cdot$} thereof;\footnotetext{Psalm 24. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin The world, and they that dwell therein.\\
For he hath founded it upon the seas,\\
\vin And established it upon the floods.\\
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?\\
\vin Or who shall stand in his holy place?\\
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;\\
\vin Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.\\
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord,\\*
\vin And righteousness from the God of his salvation.\\!

This is the generation of them that seek him,\\*
\vin That seek thy face, O Jacob. {\hge Selah}.\\
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;\\
\vin And the King of glory shall come in.\\
Who is this King of glory?\\
\vin The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.\\
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors;\\
\vin And the King of glory shall come in.\\
Who is this King of glory?\\*
\vin The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. {\hge Selah}.
