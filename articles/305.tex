The Lord is king for ever \& ever,\footnotetext{Psalm 10.18-20. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin And the heathen are perished out of the land.\\
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor;\\
\vin Thou preparest their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;\\
To help the fatherless \& poor unto their right,\\*
\vin That the man of the earth be no more exalted against them.
