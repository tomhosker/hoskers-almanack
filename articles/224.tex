\poemlines{5}
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:\footnotetext{`Ode to the West Wind' \S 5, Percy Shelley (1792 -- 1822). \cite{norton}.}\\*
What if my leaves are falling like its own!\\*
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies\\!

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,\\*
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, spirit fierce,\\*
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!\\!

Drive my dead thoughts over the universe\\*
Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!\\* 
And, by the incantation of this verse,\\!

Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth\\* 
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!\\*
Be through my lips to unawakened earth\\!

The trumpet of a prophecy! O wind,\\*
If winter comes, can spring be far behind?
\end{verse}
