\poemlines{5}
I wish I had the voice of \emph{Homer}\footnotetext{`Cancer's a Funny Thing', Prof John Haldane (1892 -- 1964). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. The title is, deliberately or not, a direct quotation from Prof Auden's `Miss Gee'. \P The portion of the poem which describes the Roman deity Janus includes a footnote, also in verse, discussing the deities of India which also have more than one face.}\\*
To sing of rectal carcinoma,\\
Which kills a lot more chaps, in fact,\\*
Than were bumped off when {\sc Troy} was sacked.\\!

I noticed I was passing blood\\*
(Only a few drops, not a flood).\\
So pausing on my homeward way\\
From {\sc Tallahassee} to {\sc Bombay}\\
I asked a doctor, now my friend,\\
To peer into my hinder end,\\
To prove or to disprove the rumour\\
That I had a malignant tumour.\\
They pumped in $\mathrm{BaS0}_4$\\
Till I could really stand no more,\\
And, when sufficient had been pressed in,\\
They photographed my large intestine.\\
In order to decide the issue\\
They next scraped out some bits of tissue.\\
(Before they did so, some good pal\\
Had knocked me out with pentothal,\\
Whose action is extremely quick,\\
And does not leave me feeling sick.)\\
The microscope returned the answer\\
That I had certainly got cancer,\\
So I was wheeled into the theatre\\
Where holes were made to make me better.\\
One set is in my perineum\\
Where I can feel, but can't yet see 'em.\\
Another made me like a kipper\\
Or female prey of \emph{Jack the Ripper}.\\
Through this incision, I don't doubt,\\
The neoplasm was taken out,\\
Along with colon, \& lymph nodes\\
Where cancer cells might find abodes.\\
A third much smaller hole is meant\\
To function as a ventral vent:\\
So now I am like two-faced \emph{Janus}\\
The only god who sees his anus.\\
I'll swear, without the risk of perjury,\\
It was a snappy bit of surgery.\\
My rectum is a serious loss to me,\\
But I've a very neat colostomy,\\
And hope, as soon as I am able,\\*
To make it keep a fixed time-table.\\!

So do not wait for aches \& pains\\*
To have a surgeon mend your drains;\\
If he says, `Cancer,' you're a dunce\\
Unless you have it out at once,\\
For if you wait it's sure to swell,\\
And may have progeny as well.\\
My final word, before I'm done,\\
Is, `Cancer can be rather fun.'\\
Thanks to the nurses \& \emph{Nye Bevan}\\
The NHS is quite like heaven\\
Provided one confronts the tumour\\
With a sufficient sense of humour.\\
I know that cancer often kills,\\
But so do cars \& sleeping pills;\\
And it can hurt one till one sweats,\\
So can bad teeth \& unpaid debts.\\
A spot of laughter, I am sure,\\
Often accelerates one's cure;\\
So let us patients do our bit\\*
To help the surgeons make us fit.
