\poemlines{5}
I do not look for holy saints to guide me on my way\footnotetext{`A Pilgrim's Way', Rudyard Kipling (1865 -- 1936). \cite{kipling}.}\\*
Or male \& female devilkins to lead my feet astray.\\
If these are added I rejoice -- if not, I shall not mind\\
So long as I have leave \& choice to meet my fellow-kind.\\
For as we come and as we go (and deadly soon go we!)\\*
The people, Lord, thy people, are good enough for me.\\!

Thus I will honour pious men whose virtue shines so bright\\*
(Though none are more amazed than I when I by chance do right)\\
And I will pity foolish men for woe their sins have bred\\
(Though 99\% of mine I brought on my own head)\\
And amorite or eremite or general averagee,\\*
The people, Lord, thy people, are good enough for me.\\!

And when they bore me overmuch, I will not shake mine ears,\\*
Recalling many 1000 such whom I have bored to tears,\\
And when they labour to impress I will not doubt nor scoff,\\
Since I myself have done no less and sometimes pulled it off.\\
Yea as we are and we are not and we pretend to be,\\*
The people, Lord, thy people, are good enough for me.\\!

And when they work me random wrong, as oftentimes hath been,\\*
I will not cherish hate too long (my hands are none too clean),\\
And when they do me random good, I will not feign surprise,\\
No more than those whom I have cheered with wayside courtesies,\\
But as we give and as we take (whate'er our takings be)\\*
The people, Lord, thy people, are good enough for me.\\!

But when I meet with frantic folk who sinfully declare\\*
There is no pardon for their sin, the same I will not spare\\
Till I have proved that heaven and hell, which in our hearts we have,\\
Show nothing irredeemable on either side the grave,\\
For as we live and as we die -- if utter death there be --\\*
The people, Lord, thy people, are good enough for me.\\!

Deliver me from every pride -- the middle, high \& low --\\*
That bars me from a brother's side, whatever pride he show,\\
And purge me from all heresies of thought \& speech \& pen\\
That bid me judge him otherwise than I am judged. Amen.\\
That I might sing of crowd or king or road-borne company,\\
That I may labour in my day, vocation and degree,\\
To prove the same by deed \& name, and hold unshakenly\\
(Where'er I go, whate'er I know, whoe'er my neighbour be)\\
This single faith in life \& death and to eternity:\\*
The people, Lord, thy people, are good enough for me.
