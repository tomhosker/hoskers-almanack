By this he knew she wept with waking eyes:\footnotetext{George Meredith (1828 -- 1909). \cite{norton}. This is taken from \emph{Modern Love}, Meredith's sequence of poems describing the breakdown of his first marriage, to an older woman named Mary.}\\* 
\vin That, at his hand's light quiver by her head,\\
\vin The strange low sobs that shook their common bed\\
Were called into her with a sharp surprise,\\
And strangled mute, like little gaping snakes,\\
\vin Dreadfully venomous to him. She lay\\
\vin Stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away\\
With muffled pulses. Then, as midnight makes\\
Her giant heart of memory \& tears\\
\vin Drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat\\
\vin Sleep's heavy measure, they from head to feet\\
Were moveless, looking through their dead black years,\\
By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall.\\
\vin Like sculptured effigies they might be seen\\
\vin Upon their marriage-tomb, the sword between;\\*
Each wishing for the sword that severs all.
