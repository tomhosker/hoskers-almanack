It is a beauteous evening, calm \& free,\footnotetext{Dr William Wordsworth. Poet Laureate (1770 -1850). \cite{norton}.}\\
\vin The holy time is quiet as a nun\\
\vin Breathless with adoration; the broad sun\\
Is sinking down in its tranquillity;\\
The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the sea;\\
\vin Listen! The mighty Being is awake,\\
\vin And doth with his eternal motion make\\
A sound like thunder -- everlastingly.\\
Dear child, dear girl, that walkest with me here,\\
\vin If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,\\
\vin \vin Thy nature is not therefore less divine:\\
Thou liest in \emph{Abraham}'s bosom all the year;\\
\vin \vin And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner shrine,\\*
\vin God being with thee when we know it not. 
\end{verse}
