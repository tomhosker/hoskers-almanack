\poemlines{5}
\vin \vin I can love both fair \& brown,\footnotetext{`The Indifferent', Very Reverend Dr John Donne (1572 -- 1631). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
Her whom abundance melts, \& her whom want betrays,\\
Her who loves loneness best, \& her who masks \& plays,\\
\vin Her whom the country formed, \& whom the town,\\
\vin \vin Her who believes, \& her who tries,\\
\vin \vin Her who still weeps with spongy eyes,\\
\vin And her who is dry cork, \& never cries;\\
\vin I can love her, \& her, and you, \& you;\\*
\vin I can love any, so she be not true.\\!

\vin \vin Will no other vice content you?\\*
Will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers?\\
Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others?\\
\vin Or doth a fear that men are true torment you?\\
\vin \vin O we are not; be not you so;\\
\vin \vin Let me, and do you, 20 know.\\
\vin Rob me, but bind me not, and let me go.\\
\vin Must I, who came to travail thorough you,\\*
\vin Grow your fixed subject, because you are true?\\!

\vin \vin \emph{Venus} heard me sigh this song,\\*
And by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore,\\
She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more.\\
\vin She went, examined, and returned ere long,\\
\vin \vin And said, `Alas, some two or three\\
\vin \vin Poor heretics in love there be\\
\vin Which think to 'stablish dangerous constancy.\\
\vin But I have told them, ``Since you will be true,\\*
\vin You shall be true to them who are false to you.{''}'
