\poemlines{5}
No, no, go not to {\sc Lethe}, neither twist\footnotetext{`Ode on Melancholy', John Keats (1795 -- 1821). \cite{treasury}.}\\* 
\vin Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;\\
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kissed\\
\vin By nightshade, ruby grape of \emph{Proserpine};\\
Make not your rosary of yew-berries,\\
\vin Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be\\
\vin \vin Your mournful \emph{Psyche}, nor the downy owl\\
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;\\
\vin For shade to shade will come too drowsily,\\*
\vin \vin And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.\\!

But when the melancholy fit shall fall\\*
\vin Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,\\
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,\\
\vin And hides the green hill in an april shroud;\\
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,\\
\vin Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,\\
\vin \vin Or on the wealth of glob\`ed peonies;\\
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,\\
\vin Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,\\*
\vin \vin And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.\\!

She dwells with beauty -- beauty that must die;\\*
\vin And joy, whose hand is ever at his lips\\
Bidding adieu; and aching pleasure nigh,\\
\vin Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:\\
Ay, in the very temple of delight\\
\vin Veiled melancholy has her sov'reign shrine,\\
\vin \vin Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue\\
\vin Can burst joy's grape against his palate fine;\\
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,\\*
\vin \vin And be among her cloudy trophies hung.
