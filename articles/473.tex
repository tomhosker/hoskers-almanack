O what is that sound which so thrills the ear\footnotetext{`O What Is That Sound', Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
\vin Down in the valley drumming, drumming?\\
Only the scarlet soldiers, dear,\\*
\vin \vin The soldiers coming.\\!

O what is that light I see flashing so clear\\*
\vin Over the distance brightly, brightly?\\
Only the sun on their weapons, dear,\\*
\vin \vin As they step lightly.\\!

O what are they doing with all that gear?\\*
\vin What are they doing this morning, this morning?\\
Only the usual manoeuvres, dear,\\*
\vin \vin Or perhaps a warning.\\!

O why have they left the road down there;\\*
\vin Why are they suddenly wheeling, wheeling?\\
Perhaps a change in the orders, dear;\\*
\vin \vin Why are you kneeling?\\!

O haven't they stopped for the doctor's care;\\*
\vin Haven't they reined their horses, their horses?\\
Why, they are none of them wounded, dear,\\*
\vin \vin None of these forces.\\!

O is it the parson they want with white hair;\\*
\vin Is it the parson, is it, is it?\\
No, they are passing his gateway, dear,\\*
\vin \vin Without a visit.\\!

O it must be the farmer who lives so near;\\*
\vin It must be the farmer so cunning, so cunning.\\
They have passed the farm already, dear,\\*
\vin \vin And now they are running.\\!

O where are you going? Stay with me here!\\*
\vin Were the vows you swore me deceiving, deceiving.\\
No, I promised to love you, dear,\\*
\vin \vin But I must be leaving.\\!

O it's broken the lock \& splintered the door;\\*
\vin O it's the gate where they're turning, turning;\\
Their feet are heavy on the floor\\*
\vin \vin And their eyes are burning.
