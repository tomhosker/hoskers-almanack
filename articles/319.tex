\begin{verse}
\poemlines{5}
My soul doth magnify the Lord,\footnotetext{`Magnificat'. \cite{bcp}. This song is a translation of Luke 1.46-55.}\\
\vin And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my saviour.\\
For he hath regarded:\\
\vin The lowliness of his hand-maiden.\\
For, behold, from henceforth\\
\vin All generations shall call me blessed.\\
For he that is mighty hath magnified me,\\
\vin And holy is his name.\\
And his mercy is on them that fear him\\
\vin Throughout all generations.\\
He hath showed strength with his arm;\\
\vin He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.\\
He hath put down the mighty from their seat,\\
\vin And hath exalted the humble \& meek.\\
He hath filled the hungry with good things:\\
\vin And the rich he hath sent empty away.\\
He remembering of his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel:\\
\vin As he promised to our forefathers, \emph{Abraham} \& his seed, for ever.
