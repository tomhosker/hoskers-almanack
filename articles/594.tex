\poemlines{5}
More than most fair, full of the living fire,\footnotetext{$\xi$ Edmund Spenser (1552 -- 1599). \cite{norton}. This is one of Spenser's \emph{Amoretti}.}\\*
\vin Kindled above unto the maker near:\\
No eyes but joys, in which all powers conspire,\\
\vin That to the world naught else be counted dear.\\
Through your bright beams doth not the blinded guest\\
\vin Shoot out his darts to base affection's wound?\\
But angels come to lead frail minds to rest\\
\vin In chaste desires on heavenly beauty bound.\\
You frame my thoughts \& fashion me within;\\
\vin You stop my tongue, \& teach my heart to speak,\\
You calm the storm that passion did begin,\\
\vin Strong through your cause, but by your virtue weak.\\ 
Dark is the world, where your light shin\`ed never;\\*
Well is he born, that may behold you ever.
\end{verse}
