\poemlines{5}
`Go,' said old \emph{Lyce}; `Senseless lover, go,\footnotetext{`Lyce', William Walsh (1662 -- 1708). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
And with soft verses court the fair; but know,\\
With all thy verses, thou canst get no more\\
Than fools without one verse have had before.'\\
Enraged at this, upon the bawd I flew;\\*
And that which most enraged me, was, 'twas true.
\end{verse}
