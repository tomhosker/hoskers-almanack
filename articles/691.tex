\vin Not a line of her writing have I,\footnotetext{$\zeta \dagger$ `Thoughts of Phena', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. The Phena in question was a Tryphena Sparks, Hardy's probable lover and cousin (or possibly niece) and at one time his intended bride. Prof Larkin commented once that reading this poem brought about his conversion to the genuinely English tradition of poetry, and away from Yeats's shoddy school.}\\*
\vin \vin Not a thread of her hair,\\
No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby\\
\vin \vin I may picture her there;\\
\vin And in vain do I urge my unsight\\
\vin \vin To conceive my lost prize\\
At her close, whom I knew when her dreams were upbrimming with light,\\*
\vin \vin And with laughter her eyes.\\!

\vin What scenes spread around her last days,\\*
\vin \vin Sad, shining, or dim?\\
Did her gifts \& compassions enray \& enarch her sweet ways\\
\vin \vin With an aureat nimb?\\
\vin Or did life-light decline from her years,\\
\vin \vin And mischances control\\
Her full day-star; unease, or regret, or forebodings, or fears\\*
\vin \vin Disennoble her soul?\\!

\vin Thus I do but the phantom retain\\*
\vin \vin Of the maiden of yore\\
As my relic; yet haply the best of her -- fined in my brain\\
\vin \vin It may be the more\\
\vin That no line of her writing have I,\\
\vin \vin Nor a thread of her hair,\\
No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby\\*
\vin \vin I may picture her there.
