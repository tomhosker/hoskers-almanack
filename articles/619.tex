\poemlines{5}
Yes, I remember {\sc Adlestrop} --\footnotetext{`Adlestrop', Edward Thomas (1878 -- 1917). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin The name, because one afternoon\\
Of heat the express-train drew up there\\*
\vin Unwontedly. It was late june.\\!

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.\\
\vin No one left \& no one came\\
On the bare platform. What I saw\\*
\vin Was {\sc Adlestrop} -- only the name\\!

And willows, willow-herb, \& grass,\\*
\vin And meadowsweet, \& haycocks dry,\\
No whit less still \& lonely fair\\*
\vin Than the high cloudlets in the sky.\\!

And for that minute a blackbird sang\\*
\vin Close by, and round him, mistier,\\
Farther \& farther, all the birds\\*
\vin Of Oxfordshire \& Gloucestershire.
