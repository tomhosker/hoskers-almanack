This lunar beauty\footnotetext{`This Lunar Beauty', Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audenb}.}\\*
Has no history,\\
Is complete \& early;\\
If beauty later\\
Bear any feature,\\
It had a lover\\*
And is another.\\!

This like a dream\\*
Keeps other time,\\
And daytime is\\
The loss of this;\\
For time is inches\\
And the heart's changes\\
Where ghost has haunted,\\*
Lost \& wanted.\\!

But this was never\\*
A ghost's endeavour\\
Nor, finished this,\\
Was ghost at ease;\\
And till it pass\\
Love shall not near\\
The sweetness here\\
Nor sorrow take\\*
His endless look.
