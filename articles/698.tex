\poemlines{5}
The {\sc Danube} to the {\sc Severn} gave\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin The darkened heart that beat no more;\\
\vin They laid him by the pleasant shore,\\*
And in the hearing of the wave.\\!

There twice a day the {\sc Severn} fills;\\*
\vin The salt sea-water passes by,\\
\vin And hushes half the babbling {\sc Wye},\\*
And makes a silence in the hills.\\!

The {\sc Wye} is hushed nor moved along,\\*
\vin And hushed my deepest grief of all,\\
\vin When filled with tears that cannot fall,\\*
I brim with sorrow drowning song.\\!

The tide flows down, the wave again\\*
\vin Is vocal in its wooded walls;\\
\vin My deeper anguish also falls,\\*
And I can speak a little then.
