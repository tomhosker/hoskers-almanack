I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,\footnotetext{`The Cloud', Percy Shelley (1792 -- 1822). \cite{norton}. This poem may well have been influenced by, and in any case bears a striking likeness to, passages in the \emph{Exeter Book of Riddles}.}\\*
\vin From the seas and the streams;\\
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid\\
\vin In their noonday dreams.\\
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken\\
\vin The sweet buds every one,\\
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,\\
\vin As she dances about the sun.\\
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,\\
\vin And whiten the green plains under,\\
And then again I dissolve it in rain,\\*
\vin And laugh as I pass in thunder.\\!

I sift the snow on the mountains below,\\*
\vin And their great pines groan aghast;\\
And all the night 'tis my pillow white,\\
\vin While I sleep in the arms of the blast.\\
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,\\
\vin Lightning my pilot sits;\\
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,\\
\vin It struggles and howls at fits;\\
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,\\
\vin This pilot is guiding me,\\
Lured by the love of the genii that move\\
\vin In the depths of the purple sea;\\
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,\\
\vin Over the lakes \& the plains,\\
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,\\
\vin The spirit he loves remains;\\
And I all the while bask in heaven's blue smile,\\*
\vin Whilst he is dissolving in rains.\\!

The sanguine sunrise, with his meteor eyes,\\*
\vin And his burning plumes outspread,\\
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,\\
\vin When the morning star shines dead;\\
As on the jag of a mountain crag,\\
\vin Which an earthquake rocks \& swings,\\
An eagle alit one moment may sit\\
\vin In the light of its golden wings.\\
And when sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,\\
\vin Its ardours of rest \& of love,\\
And the crimson pall of eve may fall\\
\vin From the depth of Heaven above,\\
With wings folded I rest, on mine a\"ery nest,\\*
\vin As still as a brooding dove.\\!

That orb\`ed maiden with white fire laden,\\*
\vin Whom mortals call the moon,\\
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,\\
\vin By the midnight breezes strewn;\\
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,\\
\vin Which only the angels hear,\\
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,\\
\vin The stars peep behind her and peer;\\
And I laugh to see them whirl \& flee,\\
\vin Like a swarm of golden bees,\\
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,\\
\vin Till calm the rivers, lakes, and seas,\\
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,\\*
\vin Are each paved with the moon and these.\\!

I bind the sun's throne with a burning zone,\\*
\vin And the moon's with a girdle of pearl;\\
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel \& swim,\\
\vin When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.\\
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,\\
\vin Over a torrent sea,\\
Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,\\
\vin The mountains its columns be.\\
The triumphal arch through which I march\\
\vin With hurricane, fire, and snow,\\
When the powers of the air are chained to my chair,\\
\vin Is the million-coloured bow;\\
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,\\*
\vin While the moist earth was laughing below.\\!

I am the daughter of earth \& water,\\*
\vin And the nursling of the sky;\\
I pass through the pores of the ocean \& shores;\\
\vin I change, but I cannot die.\\
For after the rain when with never a stain\\
\vin The pavilion of heaven is bare,\\
And the winds \& sunbeams with their convex gleams\\
\vin Build up the blue dome of air,\\
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,\\
\vin And out of the caverns of rain,\\
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,\\*
\vin I arise and unbuild it again.
