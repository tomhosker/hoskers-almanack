She turned in the high pew, until her sight\footnotetext{`A Church Romance', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. This poem is subtitled `Mellstock: circa 1835', Mellstock being a name Hardy coined himself for a village in his semi-fictional Wessex which corresponded to his native Stinsford.

\vin Swept the west gallery, and caught its row\\
\vin Of music-men with viol, book, \& bow\\
Against the sinking sad tower-window light.\\
She turned again; and in her pride's despite\\
\vin One strenuous viol's inspirer seemed to throw\\
\vin A message from his string to her below,\\
Which said: `I claim thee as my own forthright!'\\!

Thus their hearts' bond began, in due time signed.\\*
\vin And long years thence, when age had scared romance,\\
\vin At some old attitude of his or glance\\
That gallery-scene would break upon her mind,\\
\vin With him as minstrel, ardent, young, \& trim,\\*
\vin Bowing ``New Sabbath'' or ``Mount Ephraim''.
