\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
Then the {\hge LORD} answered \emph{Job} out of the whirlwind, and said,\footnotetext{Job 38-41, 42.1-6. \cite{kjv}.}\\!

Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?\\*
\vin Gird up now thy loins like a man;\\
For I will demand of thee,\\*
\vin And answer thou me.\\!

Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?\\*
\vin Declare, if thou hast understanding.\\
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?\\
\vin Or who hath stretched the line upon it?\\
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?\\
\vin Or who laid the corner stone thereof;\\
When the morning stars sang together,\\*
\vin And all the sons of God shouted for joy?\\!

Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth,\\*
\vin As if it had issued out of the womb?\\
When I made the cloud the garment thereof,\\
\vin And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,\\
And brake up for it my decreed place,\\
\vin And set bars and doors,\\
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:\\*
\vin And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?\\!

Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;\\*
\vin And caused the dayspring to know his place;\\
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,\\
\vin That the wicked might be shaken out of it?\\
It is turned as clay to the seal;\\
\vin And they stand as a garment.\\
And from the wicked their light is withholden,\\*
\vin And the high arm shall be broken.\\!

Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?\\*
\vin Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?\\
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?\\*
\vin Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?\\!

Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?\\*
\vin Declare if thou knowest it all.\\
Where is the way where light dwelleth?\\
\vin And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,\\
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,\\
\vin And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?\\
Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?\\*
\vin Or because the number of thy days is great?\\!

Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?\\*
\vin Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,\\
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,\\*
\vin Against the day of battle and war?\\!

By what way is the light parted,\\*
\vin Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?\\
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,\\
\vin Or a way for the lightning of thunder;\\
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is;\\
\vin On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;\\
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground;\\
\vin And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?\\
Hath the rain a father?\\
\vin Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?\\
Out of whose womb came the ice?\\*
\vin And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?\\!

The waters are hid as with a stone,\\*
\vin And the face of the deep is frozen.\\
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,\\
\vin Or loose the bands of Orion?\\
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?\\*
\vin Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?\\!

Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?\\*
\vin Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?\\
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,\\
\vin That abundance of waters may cover thee?\\
Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go,\\*
\vin And say unto thee, Here we are?\\!

Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?\\*
\vin Or who hath given understanding to the heart?\\
Who can number the clouds in wisdom?\\
\vin Or who can stay the bottles of heaven,\\
When the dust groweth into hardness,\\*
\vin And the clods cleave fast together?\\!

Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?\\*
\vin Or fill the appetite of the young lions,\\
When they couch in their dens,\\
\vin And abide in the covert to lie in wait?\\
Who provideth for the raven his food?\\*
\vin When his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.\\!

Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?\\*
\vin Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?\\
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?\\
\vin Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?\\
They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones,\\
\vin they cast out their sorrows.\\
Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;\\*
\vin They go forth, and return not unto them.\\!

Who hath sent out the wild ass free?\\*
\vin Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?\\
Whose house I have made the wilderness,\\
\vin And the barren land his dwellings.\\
He scorneth the multitude of the city,\\
\vin Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.\\
The range of the mountains is his pasture,\\*
\vin And he searcheth after every green thing.\\!

Will the ox be willing to serve thee,\footnotetext{98-100. Where the Almanackist has put \emph{ox}, the KJV reads \emph{unicorn}.}\\*
\vin Or abide by thy crib?\\
Canst thou bind the ox with his band in the furrow?\\
\vin Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?\\
Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?\\
\vin Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?\\
Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed,\\*
\vin And gather it into thy barn?\\!

Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?\\*
\vin Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?\\
Which leaveth her eggs in the earth,\\
\vin And warmeth them in dust,\\
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,\\
\vin Or that the wild beast may break them.\\
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers:\\
\vin Her labour is in vain without fear;\\
Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,\\
\vin Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.\\
What time she lifteth up herself on high,\\*
\vin She scorneth the horse and his rider.\\!

Hast thou given the horse strength?\\*
\vin Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?\\
Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?\\
\vin The glory of his nostrils is terrible.\\
He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:\\
\vin He goeth on to meet the armed men.\\
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;\\
\vin Neither turneth he back from the sword.\\
The quiver rattleth against him,\\
\vin The glittering spear and the shield.\\
He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:\\
\vin Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.\\
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha;\\
\vin And he smelleth the battle afar off,\\
The thunder of the captains,\\*
\vin And the shouting.\\!

Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,\\*
\vin And stretch her wings toward the south?\\
Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,\\
\vin And make her nest on high?\\
She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,\\
\vin Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.\\
From thence she seeketh the prey,\\
\vin And her eyes behold afar off.\\
Her young ones also suck up blood:\\*
\vin And where the slain are, there is she.\\!

Moreover, the {\hge LORD} answered \emph{Job}, and said,\\!

Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?\\*
\vin He that reproveth God, let him answer it.\\!

Then \emph{Job} answered the {\hge LORD}, and said,\\!

Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?\\*
\vin I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.\\
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer:\\*
\vin Yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.\\!

Then answered the {\hge LORD} unto \emph{Job} out of the whirlwind, and said,\\!

Gird up thy loins now\\*
\vin Like a man:\\
I will demand of thee,\\*
\vin And declare thou unto me.\\!

Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?\\*
\vin Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?\\
Hast thou an arm like God?\\
\vin Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?\\
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency;\\
\vin And array thyself with glory and beauty.\\
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:\\
\vin And behold every one that is proud, and abase him.\\
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;\\
\vin And tread down the wicked in their place.\\
Hide them in the dust together;\\
\vin And bind their faces in secret.\\
Then will I also confess unto thee\\*
\vin That thine own right hand can save thee.\\!

Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee;\\*
\vin He eateth grass as an ox.\\
Lo now, his strength is in his loins,\\
\vin And his force is in the navel of his belly.\\
He moveth his tail like a cedar:\\
\vin The sinews of his stones are wrapped together.\\
His bones are as strong pieces of brass;\\
\vin His bones are like bars of iron.\\
He is the chief of the ways of God:\\
\vin He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.\\
Surely the mountains bring him forth food,\\
\vin Where all the beasts of the field play.\\
He lieth under the shady trees,\\
\vin In the covert of the reed, and fens.\\
The shady trees cover him with their shadow;\\
\vin The willows of the brook compass him about.\\
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not:\\
\vin He trusteth that he can draw up {\sc Jordan} into his mouth.\\
He taketh it with his eyes:\\*
\vin His nose pierceth through snares.\\!

Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?\\*
\vin Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?\\
Canst thou put an hook into his nose?\\
\vin Or bore his jaw through with a thorn?\\
Will he make many supplications unto thee?\\
\vin Will he speak soft words unto thee?\\
Will he make a covenant with thee?\\
\vin Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?\\
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?\\
\vin Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?\\
Shall the companions make a banquet of him?\\
\vin Shall they part him among the merchants?\\
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\\
\vin Or his head with fish spears?\\
Lay thine hand upon him,\\
\vin Remember the battle, do no more.\\
Behold, the hope of him is in vain:\\
\vin Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?\\
None is so fierce that dare stir him up:\\
\vin Who then is able to stand before me?\\
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?\\
\vin Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.\\
I will not conceal his parts, nor his power,\\
\vin Nor his comely proportion.\\
Who can discover the face of his garment?\\
\vin Or who can come to him with his double bridle?\\
Who can open the doors of his face?\\
\vin His teeth are terrible round about.\\
His scales are his pride,\\
\vin Shut up together as with a close seal.\\
One is so near to another,\\
\vin That no air can come between them.\\
They are joined one to another,\\
\vin They stick together, that they cannot be sundered.\\
By his neesings a light doth shine,\\
\vin And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.\\
Out of his mouth go burning lamps,\\
\vin And sparks of fire leap out.\\
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,\\
\vin As out of a seething pot or caldron.\\
His breath kindleth coals,\\
\vin And a flame goeth out of his mouth.\\
In his neck remaineth strength,\\
\vin And sorrow is turned into joy before him.\\
The flakes of his flesh are joined together:\\
\vin They are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.\\\
His heart is as firm as a stone;\\
\vin Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.\\
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid:\\
\vin By reason of breakings they purify themselves.\\
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold:\\
\vin The spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.\\
He esteemeth iron as straw,\\
\vin And brass as rotten wood.\\
The arrow cannot make him flee:\\
\vin Slingstones are turned with him into stubble.\\
Darts are counted as stubble:\\
\vin He laugheth at the shaking of a spear.\\
Sharp stones are under him:\\
\vin He spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.\\
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:\\
\vin He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.\\
He maketh a path to shine after him;\\
\vin One would think the deep to be hoary.\\
Upon earth there is not his like,\\
\vin Who is made without fear.\\
He beholdeth all high things:\\*
\vin He is a king over all the children of pride.\\!

Then \emph{Job} answered the {\hge LORD}, and said,\\!

I know that thou canst do every thing,\\*
\vin And that no thought can be withholden from thee.\\
Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?\\
\vin Therefore have I uttered that I understood not;\\
Things too wonderful for me,\\
\vin Which I knew not.\\
Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak:\\
\vin I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.\\
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear:\\
\vin But now mine eye seeth thee.\\
Wherefore I abhor myself,\\*
\vin And repent in dust and ashes.
