They shut the road through the woods\footnotetext{`The Way Through the Woods', Rudyard Kipling (1865 -- 1936). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. The Almanackist was forced to compose a pastiche of this poem as a small child.}\\*
Seventy years ago.\\
Weather \& rain have undone it again,\\
And now you would never know\\
There was once a road through the woods\\
Before they planted the trees.\\
It is underneath the coppice \& heath,\\
And the thin anemones.\\
Only the keeper sees\\
That, where the ring-dove broods,\\
And the badgers roll at ease,\\*
There was once a road through the woods.\\!

Yet, if you enter the woods\\*
Of a summer evening late,\\
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools\\*
Where the otter whistles his mate\\
(They fear not men in the woods,\\
Because they see so few),\\
You will hear the beat of a horse's feet,\\
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,\\
Steadily cantering through\\
The misty solitudes,\\
As though they perfectly knew\\
The old lost road through the woods...\\*
But there is no road through the woods.
