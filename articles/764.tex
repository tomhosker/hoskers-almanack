It's hard when folks can't find their work\footnotetext{$\xi$ `The Dalesman's Litany', Frederic Moorman (1872 -- 1918). \cite{moorman}. Tim Hart wrote in the sleeve notes to \emph{Folk Songs of Old England Vol 1} (1968):`The words of this song were collected by F W Moorman who was president of the Yorkshire Dialect Society during the latter part of the 19th century. The beautiful haunting melody was written only a few years ago by Dave Keddie of Bradford to whom we are indebted for allowing its inclusion on this record. Although the lyrics were originally in broad dialect Tim translated them where necessary to enable more people to understand them.' \P The penultimate line of the Moorman's version has been excised in order to fit the tune.}\\*
\vin Where they've been bred an' born;\\
I were young I always thought\\
\vin I'd bide 'mong t'roots an' corn.\\
I've bin forced to work i' towns,\\
\vin So here's my litany:\\
From {\sc Hull}, an' {\sc Halifax}, an' hell,\\*
\vin Good Lord, deliver me!\\!

When I were courtin' Mary Ann,\\*
\vin T'owd squire, he says one day:\\
`I've got no bield for wedded folks;\\
\vin Choose, wilt ta wed or stay?'\\
I couldn't gi'e up t'lass I loved;\\
\vin To t'town we had to flee:\\
From {\sc Hull}, an' {\sc Halifax}, an' hell,\\*
\vin Good Lord, deliver me!\\!

I've wrought i'{\sc Leeds} an' {\sc Huddersfield},\\*
\vin An' addled honest brass;\\
I'{\sc Bradford}, {\sc Keighley}, {\sc Rotherham},\\
\vin I've kept my barns an' lass.\\
I've travelled all three Ridin's round,\\
\vin And once I went to sea:\\
From forges, mills, an' coalin' boats,\\*
\vin Good Lord, deliver me!\\!

I've walked at night through {\sc Sheffield} lanes,\\*
\vin 'Twere same as bein' i' hell:\\
Furnaces thrust out tongues o' fire,\\
\vin An' roared like t'wind on t'fell.\\
I've sammed up coals i'{\sc Barnsley} pits,\\
\vin Wi' muck up to my knee:\\
From {\sc Sheffield}, {\sc Barnsley}, {\sc Rotherham},\\*
\vin Good Lord, deliver me!\\!

I've seen grey fog creep o'er {\sc Leeds Bridge}\\*
\vin As thick as bastile soup;\\
I've lived where folks were stowed away\\
\vin Like rabbits in a coop.\\
I've watched snow float down {\sc Bradford Beck}\\
\vin As black as ebony:\\
From {\sc Hunslet}, {\sc Holbeck}, {\sc Wibsey Slack},\\*
\vin Good Lord, deliver me!\\!

But now, when all wer children's fledged,\\*
\vin To t'country we've come back.\\
There's 40 mile o' heathery moor\\
\vin Twix' us an' t'coal-pit slack.\\
And when I sit o'er t'fire at night,\\
\vin I laugh an' shout wi' glee:\\
From {\sc Hull}, an' {\sc Halifax}, an' hell,\\*
\vin T'good Lord's delivered me!
