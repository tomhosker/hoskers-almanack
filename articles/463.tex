If it form the landscape that we, the inconstant ones,\footnotetext{`In Praise of Limestone', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
\vin Are constantly homesick for, this is chiefly\\
Because it dissolves in water. Mark these rounded slopes\\
\vin With their surface fragrance of thyme and, beneath,\\
A secret system of caves \& conduits; hear the springs\\
\vin That spurt out everywhere with a chuckle,\\
Each filling a private pool for its fish and carving\\
\vin Its own little ravine whose cliffs entertain\\
The butterfly \& the lizard; examine this region\\
\vin Of short distances \& definite places:\\
What could be more like mother or a fitter background\\
\vin For her son, the flirtatious male who lounges\\
Against a rock in the sunlight, never doubting\\
\vin That for all his faults he is loved; whose works are but\\
Extensions of his power to charm? From weathered outcrop\\
\vin To hill-top temple, from appearing waters to\\
Conspicuous fountains, from a wild to a formal vineyard,\\
\vin Are ingenious but short steps that a child's wish\\
To receive more attention than his brothers, whether\\*
\vin By pleasing or teasing, can easily take.\\!

Watch, then, the band of rivals as they climb up \& down\\*
\vin The steep stone gennels in twos \& threes, at times\\
Arm in arm, but never, thank God, in step; or engaged\\
\vin On a shady side of a square at midday in\\
Voluble discourse, knowing each other too well to think\\
\vin There are any important secrets, unable\\
To conceive a god whose temper-tantrums are moral\\
\vin And not to be pacified by a clever line\\
Or a good lay: for, accustomed to a stone that responds,\\
\vin They have never had to veil their faces in awe\\
Of a crater whose blazing fury could not be fixed;\\
\vin Adjusted to the local needs of valleys\\
Where everything can be touched or reached by walking,\\
\vin Their eyes have never looked into infinite space\\
Through the lattice-work of a nomad's comb; born lucky,\\
\vin Their legs have never encountered the fungi\\
And insects of the jungle, the monstrous forms \& lives\\
\vin With which we have nothing, we like to think, in common.\\
So, when one of them goes to the bad, the way his mind works\\
\vin Remains comprehensible: to become a pimp\\
Or deal in fake jewellery or ruin a fine tenor voice\\
\vin For effects that bring down the house, could happen to all\\
But the best \& the worst of us... That is why, I suppose,\\
\vin The best \& worst never stayed here long but sought\\
Immoderate soils where the beauty was not so external,\\
\vin The light less public and the meaning of life\\
Something more than a mad camp. `Come!' cried the granite wastes,\\
\vin `How evasive is your humour, how accidental\\
Your kindest kiss, how permanent is death.' (Saints-to-be\\
\vin Slipped away sighing.) `Come!' purred the clays \& gravels,\\
`On our plains there is room for armies to drill; rivers\\
\vin Wait to be tamed and slaves to construct you a tomb\\
In the grand manner: soft as the earth is mankind and both\\
\vin Need to be altered.' (Intendant Caesars rose and\\
Left, slamming the door.) But the really reckless were fetched\\
\vin By an older colder voice, the oceanic whisper:\\
`I am the solitude that asks \& promises nothing;\\
\vin That is how I shall set you free. There is no love;\\*
There are only the various envies, all of them sad.\\!

\vin They were right, my dear; all those voices were right\\*
And still are; this land is not the sweet home that it looks,\\
\vin Nor its peace the historical calm of a site\\
Where something was settled once \& for all: a backward\\
\vin And dilapidated province, connected\\
To the big busy world by a tunnel, with a certain\\
\vin Seedy appeal, is that all it is now? Not quite:\\
It has a worldly duty which in spite of itself\\
\vin It does not neglect, but calls into question\\
All the great powers assume; it disturbs our rights. The poet,\\
\vin Admired for his earnest habit of calling\\
The sun the sun, his mind puzzle, is made uneasy\\
\vin By these marble statues which so obviously doubt\\
His anti-mythological myth; and these gamins,\\
\vin Pursuing the scientist down the tiled colonnade\\
With such lively offers, rebuke his concern for nature's\\
\vin Remotest aspects: I, too, am reproached, for what\\
And how much you know. Not to lose time, not to get caught,\\
\vin Not to be left behind, not -- please! -- to resemble\\
The beasts who repeat themselves or a thing like water\\
\vin Or stone whose conduct can be predicted, these\\
Are our {\hge Common Prayer}, whose greatest comfort is music\\
\vin Which can be made anywhere, is invisible,\\
And does not smell. In so far as we have to look forward\\
\vin To death as a fact, no doubt we are right: but if\\
Sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise from the dead,\\
\vin These modifications of matter into\\
Innocent athletes \& gesticulating fountains,\\
\vin Made solely for pleasure, make a further point:\\
The bless\`ed will not care what angle they are regarded from,\\
\vin Having nothing to hide. Dear, I know nothing of\\
Either, but when I try to imagine a faultless love\\
\vin Or the life to come, what I hear is the murmur\\*
Of underground streams, what I see is a limestone landscape.
