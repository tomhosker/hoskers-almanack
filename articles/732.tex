\poemlines{5}
My love looks like a girl tonight,\footnotetext{`The Bride', David Lawrence (1885 -- 1930). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
\vin But she is old.\\
The plaits that lie along her pillow\\
\vin Are not gold,\\
But threaded with filigree silver\\*
\vin And uncanny cold.\\!

She looks like a young maiden, since her brow\\*
\vin Is smooth \& fair;\\
Her cheeks are very smooth; her eyes are closed.\\
\vin She sleeps a rare\\*
Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.\\!

Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams\\*
\vin Of perfect things.\\
She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream.\\
\vin And her dead mouth sings\\*
By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.
