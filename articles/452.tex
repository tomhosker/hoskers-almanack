A flock of sheep that leisurely pass by\footnotetext{`To Sleep', Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
\vin One after one; the sound of rain, and bees\\
\vin Murmuring; the fall of rivers, winds \& seas,\\
Smooth fields, white sheets of water, \& pure sky --\\
I've thought of all by turns, and still I lie\\
\vin Sleepless; and soon the small birds' melodies\\
\vin Must hear, first uttered from my orchard trees,\\
And the first cuckoo's melancholy cry.\\
Even thus last night, \& two nights more I lay,\\
\vin And could not win thee, sleep, by any stealth:\\
So do not let me wear tonight away.\\
\vin Without thee what is all the morning's wealth?\\
Come, blessed barrier between day \& day,\\*
\vin Dear mother of fresh thoughts \& joyous health!
