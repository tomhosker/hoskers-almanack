Stay, O sweet, and do not rise.\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{newlove}. This poem is often attributed to the Very Reverend Dr Donne, with some other verses (sadly of inferior quality) affixed. However, Prof Stallworthy contests this, attributing the poem to `Anon' instead. Prof Sir Herbert Grierson suggests the true author may have been a John Dowland.}\\*
The light that shines comes from thine eyes:\\
The day breaks not: it is my heart,\\
Because that you \& I must part.\\
\vin Stay, or else my joys will die\\*
\vin And perish in their infancy.
