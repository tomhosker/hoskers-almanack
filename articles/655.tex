\poemlines{5}
Like the touch of rain she was\footnotetext{Edward Thomas (1878 -- 1917). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
On a man's flesh \& hair \& eyes\\
When the joy of walking thus\\*
Has taken him by surprise:\\!

With the love of the storm he burns;\\*
He sings; he laughs; well I know how,\\
But forgets when he returns\\*
As I shall not forget her ``Go now''.\\!

Those two words shut a door\\*
Between me and the blessed rain\\
That was never shut before\\*
And will not open again.
\end{verse}
