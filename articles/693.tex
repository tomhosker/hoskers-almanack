\vin Now winter nights enlarge\footnotetext{Dr Thomas Campion (1567 -- 1620). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin \vin The number of their hours;\\
\vin And clouds their storms discharge\\
\vin \vin Upon the airy towers.\\
\vin Let now the chimneys blaze\\
\vin \vin And cups o'erflow with wine;\\
\vin Let well-turned words amaze\\
\vin With harmony divine.\\
\vin Now yellow waxen lights\\
\vin \vin Shall wait on honey love\\
While youthful revels, masques \& courtly sights\\*
\vin \vin Sleep's leaden spells remove.\\!

\vin This time doth well dispense\\*
\vin \vin With lovers' long discourse;\\
\vin Much speech hath some defense,\\
\vin \vin Though beauty no remorse.\\
\vin All do not all things well;\\
\vin \vin Some measures comely tread,\\
\vin Some knotted riddles tell,\\
\vin \vin Some poems smoothly read.\\
\vin The summer hath his joys,\\
\vin \vin And winter his delights;\\
Though love \& all his pleasures are but toys,\\*
\vin \vin They shorten tedious nights.
