When I watch the living meet,\footnotetext{Prof Alfred Housman (1859 -- 1936). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin And the moving pageant file\\
Warm \& breathing through the street\\*
\vin Where I lodge a little while,\\!

If the heats of hate \& lust\\*
\vin In the house of flesh are strong,\\
Let me mind the house of dust\\*
\vin Where my sojourn shall be long.\\!

In the nation that is not\\*
\vin Nothing stands that stood before;\\
There revenges are forgot,\\*
\vin And the hater hates no more;\\!

Lovers lying two \& two\\*
\vin Ask not whom they sleep beside,\\
And the bridegroom all night through\\*
\vin Never turns him to the bride.
\end{verse}
