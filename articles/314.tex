\poemlines{5}
Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle?\footnotetext{Psalm 15. \cite{bcp}. For obvious reasons, this psalm is sometimes referred to as the ``Gentelman's Psalm''.}\\*
\vin Or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?\\
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life,\\
\vin And doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.\\
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour,\\
\vin And hath not slandered his neighbour.\\
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes,\\
\vin And maketh much of them that fear the Lord.\\
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not,\\
\vin Though it were to his own hindrance.\\
He that hath not given his money upon usury,\\
\vin Nor taken reward against the innocent.\\
Whoso doeth these things\\*
\vin Shall never fall.
