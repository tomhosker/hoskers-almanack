\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
When midnight comes a host of dogs \& men\footnotetext{`Badger', John Clare (1793 -- 1864). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Go out and track the badger to his den,\\
And put a sack within the hole, and lie\\
Till the old grunting badger passes by.\\
He comes and hears. They let the strongest loose.\\
The old fox hears the noise and drops the goose.\\
The poacher shoots and hurries from the cry,\\
And the old hare half wounded buzzes by.\\
They get a forked stick to bear him down\\
And clap the dogs and take him to the town,\\
And bait him all the day with many dogs,\\
And laugh \& shout \& fright the scampering hogs.\\
He runs along and bites at all he meets:\\*
They shout \& hollo down the noisy streets.\\!

He turns about to face the loud uproar\\*
And drives the rebels to their very door.\\
The frequent stone is hurled where'er they go;\\
When badgers fight, then everyone's a foe.\\
The dogs are clapped and urged to join the fray;\\
The badger turns and drives them all away.\\
Though scarcely half as big, demure \& small,\\
He fights with dogs for bones and beats them all.\\
The heavy mastiff, savage in the fray,\\
Lies down and licks his feet and turns away.\\
The bulldog knows his match and waxes cold,\\
The badger grins and never leaves his hold.\\
He drives the crowd and follows at their heels\\*
And bites them through; the drunkard swears \& reels.\\!

The frighted women take the boys away,\\*
The blackguard laughs and hurries on the fray.\\
He tries to reach the woods, an awkward race,\\
But sticks \& cudgels quickly stop the chase.\\
He turns againn and drives the noisy crowd\\
And beats the many dogs in noises loud.\\
He drives away and beats them every one,\\
And then they loose them all and set them on.\\
He falls as dead and kicked by boys \& men,\\
Then starts and grins and drives the crowd again;\\
Till kicked \& torn \& beaten out he lies\\*
And leaves his hold and cackles, groans, \& dies.
