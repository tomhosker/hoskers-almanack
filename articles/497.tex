Can I see another's woe,\footnotetext{`On Anothers Sorrow', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
And not be in sorrow too?\\
Can I see another's grief,\\*
And not seek for kind relief?\\!

Can I see a falling tear,\\*
And not feel my sorrow's share?\\
Can a father see his child\\*
Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?\\!

Can a mother sit and hear\\*
An infant groan, an infant fear?\\
No, no. Never can it be.\\*
Never, never can it be.\\!

And can he who smiles on all\\*
Hear the wren with sorrows small,\\
Hear the small bird's grief \& care,\\*
Hear the woes that infants bear\\!

And not sit beside the nest,\\*
Pouring pity in their breast?\\
And not sit the cradle near,\\*
Weeping tear on infant's tear?\\!

And not sit both night \& day,\\*
Wiping all our tears away?\\
O no. Never can it be.\\*
Never, never can it be.\\!

He doth give his joy to all:\\*
He becomes an infant small:\\
He becomes a man of woe:\\*
He doth feel the sorrow too.\\!

Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,\\*
And thy Maker is not by:\\
Think not thou canst weep a tear,\\*
And thy Maker is not near.\\!

O he gives to us his joy\\*
That our grief he may destroy:\\
Till our grief is fled \& gone\\*
He doth sit by us and moan.
