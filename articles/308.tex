Intreat me not to leave thee,\footnotetext{Ruth 1.16-17. \cite{kjv}. This passage from Ruth often forms part of the Jewish marriage ceremony.}\\
\vin Or to return from following after thee:\\
For whither thou goest, I will go;\\
\vin And where thou lodgest, I will lodge:\\
Thy people shall be my people,\\
\vin And thy God my God:\\
Where thou diest, will I die,\\
\vin And there will I be buried:\\
The {\hge LORD} do so to me, and more also,\\
\vin If ought but death part thee \& me.
