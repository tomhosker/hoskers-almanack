`Is my team ploughing,\footnotetext{$\xi$ Prof Alfred Housman (1859 -- 1936). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
\vin That I was used to drive\\
And hear the harness jingle\\* 
\vin When I was man alive?'\\!

Aye, the horses trample,\\*
\vin The harness jingles now;\\
No change though you lie under\\*
\vin The land you used to plough.\\!

`Is football playing\\*
\vin Along the river shore,\\
With lads to chase the leather,\\*
\vin Now I stand up no more?'\\!

Ay, the ball is flying;\\*
\vin The lads play heart \& soul;\\
The goal stands up, the keeper\\*
\vin Stands up to keep the goal.\\!

`Is my girl happy,\\*
\vin That I thought hard to leave,\\
And has she tired of weeping\\*
\vin As she lies down at eve?'\\!

Ay, she lies down lightly;\\*
\vin She lies not down to weep.\\
Your girl is well contented.\\*
\vin Be still, my lad, and sleep.\\!

`Is my friend hearty,\\*
\vin Now I am thin \& pine,\\
And has he found to sleep in\\*
\vin A better bed than mine?'\\!

Yes, lad, I lie easy;\\*
\vin I lie as lads would choose;\\
I cheer a dead man's sweetheart,\\*
\vin Never ask me whose.
