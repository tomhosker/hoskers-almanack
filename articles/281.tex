God, from whom all holy desires,\footnotetext{\cite{bcp}. The original prayer concludes, `through the merits of Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.'} all good counsels, and all just works do proceed: give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give; that our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments, and also that by thee we being defended from the fear of our enemies may pass our time in rest \& quietness. Amen.
