All my past life is mine no more;\footnotetext{`Love and Life', John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester (1647 -- 1680). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin The flying hours are gone\\
Like transitory dreams giv'n o'er,\\
Whose images are kept in store\\*
\vin By memory alone.\\!

The time that is to come is not.\\*
\vin How can it then be mine?\\
The present moment's all my lot;\\
And that, as fast as it is got,\\*
\vin \emph{Phyllis}, is only thine.\\!

Then talk not of inconstancy,\\*
\vin False hearts \& broken vows;\\
If I, by miracle, can be\\
This live-long minute true to thee,\\*
\vin 'Tis all that heav'n allows.
