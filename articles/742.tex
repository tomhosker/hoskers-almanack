The world is too much with us; late \& soon,\footnotetext{Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850). \cite{norton}. \P Proteus and Triton are minor aquatic deities from Greek mythology who appear in Homer's {\greektext >Od'usseia} and Hesiod's {\greektext Jeogon'ia} respectively.}\\*
Getting \& spending, we lay waste our powers;\\
Little we see in nature that is ours;\\
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\\
This sea that bares her bosom to the moon,\\
The winds that will be howling at all hours,\\
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers,\\
For this, for everything, we are out of tune;\\
It moves us not. Great God! I'd rather be\\
A pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\\
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\\
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\\
Have sight of \emph{Proteus} rising from the sea;\\*
Or hear old \emph{Triton} blow his wreath\`ed horn.
