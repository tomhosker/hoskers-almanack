That which her slender waist confined\footnotetext{`On a Girdle', Edmund Waller (1606 -- 1687). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
Shall now my joyful temples bind;\\
No monarch but would give his crown\\*
His arms might do what this has done.\\!

It was my heaven's extremest sphere,\\*
The pale which held that lovely deer\\
My joy, my grief, my hope, my love\\*
Did all within this circle move.\\!

A narrow compass! and yet there\\*
Dwelt all that's good, \& all that's fair:\\
Give me but what this ribband bound,\\*
Take all the rest the sun goes round.
\end{verse}
