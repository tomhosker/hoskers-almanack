Let me not to the marriage of true minds\footnotetext{`Man's Love', William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1660). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
Admit impediments. Love is not love\\
Which alters when it alteration finds,\\*
Or bends with the remover to remove:--\\!

O no! it is an ever-fix\`ed mark\\*
That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;\\
It is the star to every wandering bark,\\*
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.\\!

Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips \& cheeks\\*
Within his bending sickle's compass come;\\
Love alters not with his brief hours \& weeks,\\*
But bears it out ev'n to the edge of doom:--\\!

If this be error, and upon me proved,\\*
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
\end{verse}
