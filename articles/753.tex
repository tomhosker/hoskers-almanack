\poemlines{5}
Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking --\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{rusby_while_mortals_sleep}. This song was arranged in the nineteenth century by one Joe Perkin, a local choirmaster, from various traditions that had grown up in the village of Holmfirth in the West Riding of Yorkshire. \P The word \emph{pretty} is pronounced to rhyme with \emph{tatty} in the strain of the Yorkshire dialect peculiar to Holmfirth.}\\*
It was one summer summer's evening clear --\\
There I beheld a most beautiful damsel,\\*
Lamenting for her shepherd swain.\\!

`The fairest evening that e'er I beheld\\*
Was ever evermore with the lad I adore.\\
Wilt thou fight yon french \& spaniards?\\*
Wilt thou leave me thus, my dear?\\!

`No more to yon green banks will I take thee,\\*
With pleasure for to rest yourself and view the land.\\
But I will take you to yon green gardens,\\*
Where the pretty pretty flowers grow.'
\end{verse}
