As I listened from a beach-chair in the shade\footnotetext{`Their Lonely Betters', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
To all the noises that my garden made,\\
It seemed to me only proper that words\\*
Should be withheld from vegetables \& birds.\\!

A robin with no christian name ran through\\*
The robin-anthem which was all it knew,\\
While rustling flowers for some third party waited\\*
To say which pairs, if any, should get mated.\\!

Not one of them was capable of lying;\\*
There was not one of them which knew that it was dying,\\
Or could have with a rhythm or a rhyme\\*
Assumed responsibility for time.\\!

Let them leave language to their lonely betters\\*
Who count some days and long for certain letters;\\
We, too, make noises when we laugh or weep:\\*
Words are for those with promises to keep.
