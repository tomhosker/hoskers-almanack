\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
When I do count the clock that tells the time,\footnotetext{Sonnet 12, William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;\\
When I behold the violet past prime,\\
\vin And sable curls all silvered o'er with white;\\
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves\\
\vin Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,\\
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves\\
\vin Borne on the bier with white \& bristly beard,\\
Then of thy beauty do I question make,\\
\vin That thou among the wastes of time must go,\\
Since sweets \& beauties do themselves forsake\\
\vin And die as fast as they see others grow;\\
And nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence\\*
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
\end{verse}
