\poemlines{5}
I can't imagine anything\footnotetext{`No, Plato, No', Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
\vin That I would less like to be\\
Than a disincarnate spirit,\\
\vin Unable to chew or sip\\
Or make contact with surfaces\\
\vin Or breathe the scents of summer\\
Or comprehend speech or music\\
\vin Or gaze at what lies beyond.\\
No, God has placed me exactly\\
\vin Where I'd have chosen to be:\\
The sub-lunar world is such fun,\\
\vin Where man is male or female\\
And gives proper names to all things.\\!

\vin I can, however, conceive\\*
That the organs nature gave me,\\
\vin My ductless glands for instance,\\
Slaving 24 hours a day\\
\vin With no show of resentment\\
To gratify me, their master,\\
\vin And keep me in proper shape,\\
(Not that I give them their orders;\\
\vin I wouldn't know what to yell)\\
Dream of another existence\\
\vin Than that they have known so far.\\
Yes, it could well be that my flesh,\\
\vin Is praying for `him' to die,\\
So setting her free to become\\*
\vin Irresponsible matter.
