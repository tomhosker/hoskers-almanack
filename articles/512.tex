In futurity\footnotetext{`The Little Girl Lost', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}. Blake wrote a kind of sequel to this poem, called `The Little Girl Found'.}\\*
I prophetic see\\
That the earth from sleep\\*
(Grave the sentence deep)\\!

Shall arise and seek\\*
For her maker meek;\\
And in the desert wild\\*
Become a garden mild.\\!

In the southern clime,\\*
Where the summer's prime\\
Never fades away,\\*
Lovely \emph{Lyca} lay.\\!

Seven summers old\\*
Lovely \emph{Lyca} told;\\
She had wandered long\\*
Hearing wild birds' song.\\!

`Sweet sleep, come to me\\*
Underneath this tree.\\
Do father, mother weep,\\*
Where can \emph{Lyca} sleep?\\!

`Lost in desert wild\\*
Is your little child.\\
How can \emph{Lyca} sleep\\*
If her mother weep?\\!

`If her heart does ache\\*
Then let \emph{Lyca} wake;\\
If my mother sleep,\\*
\emph{Lyca} shall not weep.\\!

`Frowning, frowning night,\\*
O'er this desert bright,\\
Let thy moon arise\\*
While I close my eyes.'\\!

Sleeping \emph{Lyca} lay,\\*
While the beasts of prey\\
Come from caverns deep,\\*
Viewed the maid asleep.\\!

The kingly lion stood\\*
And the virgin viewed,\\
Then he gambolled round\\*
O'er the hollowed ground.\\!

Leopards, tygers, play\\*
Round her as she lay,\\
While the lion old\\*
Bowed his mane of gold;\\!

And her bosom lick,\\*
And upon her neck;\\
From his eyes of flame\\*
Ruby tears there came;\\!

While the lioness\\*
Loosed her slender dress,\\
And naked they conveyed\\*
To caves the sleeping maid.
