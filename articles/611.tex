There be none of beauty's daughters\footnotetext{George Noel, 6th Baron Byron (1788 -- 1824). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
\vin With a magic like thee;\\
And like music on the waters\\
\vin Is thy sweet voice to me:\\
When, as if its sound were causing\\
The charm\`ed ocean's pausing,\\
The waves lie still \& gleaming,\\*
And the lulled winds seem dreaming:\\!

And the midnight moon is weaving\\*
\vin Her bright chain o'er the deep,\\
Whose breast is gently heaving\\
\vin As an infant's asleep:\\
So the spirit bows before thee\\
To listen \& adore thee;\\
With a full but soft emotion,\\*
Like the swell of summer's ocean.
\end{verse}
