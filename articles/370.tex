\vin St \emph{Agnes}' Eve -- ah bitter chill it was!\footnotetext{John Keats (1795 -- 1821). \cite{norton}. Agnes is the patron-saint of virgins; her feast falls on the twenty-first day of January, hence the Eve of St Agnes is the twentieth. In English folklore, it is said that if a girl -- presumably she has to be undefiled -- goes without any supper on the Eve of St Agnes and afterwards falls asleep stark naked on her bed, she will enjoy a pleasant dream wherein the identity of her future husband will be revealed to her.}\\* 
\vin The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;\\
\vin The hare limped, trembling through the frozen grass,\\
\vin And silent was the flock in woolly fold:\\
\vin Numb were the beadsman's fingers, while he told\\
\vin His rosary, and while his frosted breath,\\
\vin Like pious incense from a censer old,\\
\vin Seemed taking flight for heaven, without a death,\\*
Past the sweet Virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith.\\!

\vin His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man;\\*
\vin Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees,\\
\vin And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan,\\
\vin Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees:\\
\vin The sculptured dead, on each side, seem to freeze,\\
\vin Emprisoned in black, purgatorial rails:\\
\vin Knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries,\\
\vin He passeth by; and his weak spirit fails\\*
To think how they may ache in icy hoods \& mails.\\!

\vin Northward he turneth through a little door,\\*
\vin And scarce three steps, ere music's golden tongue\\
\vin Flattered to tears this ag\`ed man \& poor;\\
\vin But no -- already had his deathbell rung;\\
\vin The joys of all his life were said \& sung:\\
\vin His was harsh penance on St \emph{Agnes}' Eve:\\
\vin Another way he went, and soon among\\
\vin Rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve,\\*
And all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve.\\!

\vin That ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft;\\*
\vin And so it chanced, for many a door was wide,\\
\vin From hurry to \& fro. Soon, up aloft,\\
\vin The silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide:\\
\vin The level chambers, ready with their pride,\\
\vin Were glowing to receive a 1000 guests:\\
\vin The carv\`ed angels, ever eager-eyed,\\
\vin Star, where upon their heads the cornice rests,\\*
With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts.\\!

\vin At length burst in the argent revelry,\\*
\vin With plume, tiara, \& all rich array,\\
\vin Numerous as shadows haunting faerily\\
\vin The brain, new-stuffed, in youth, with triumphs gay\\
\vin Of old romance. These let us wish away,\\
\vin And turn, sole-thoughted, to one lady there,\\
\vin Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day,\\
\vin On love, and winged St \emph{Agnes}' saintly care,\\*
As she had heard old dames full many times declare.\\!

\vin They told her how, upon St \emph{Agnes}' Eve,\\*
\vin Young virgins might have visions of delight,\\
\vin And soft adorings from their loves receive\\
\vin Upon the honeyed middle of the night,\\
\vin If ceremonies due they did aright;\\
\vin As, supperless to bed they must retire,\\
\vin And couch supine their beauties, lily white;\\
\vin Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require\\*
Of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.\\!

\vin Full of this whim was thoughtful \emph{Madeline}:\\*
\vin The music, yearning like a God in pain,\\
\vin She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine,\\
\vin Fixed on the floor, saw many a sweeping train\\
\vin Pass by -- she heeded not at all: in vain\\
\vin Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier,\\
\vin And back retired; not cooled by high disdain,\\
\vin But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere:\\*
She sighed for \emph{Agnes}' dreams, the sweetest of the year.\\!

\vin She danced along with vague, regardless eyes,\\*
\vin Anxious her lips, her breathing quick \& short:\\ 
\vin The hallowed hour was near at hand: she sighs\\
\vin Amid the timbrels, and the thronged resort\\
\vin Of whisperers in anger, or in sport;\\
\vin 'Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, \& scorn,\\
\vin Hoodwinked with faery fancy; all amort,\\
\vin Save to St \emph{Agnes} \& her lambs unshorn,\\*
And all the bliss to be before tomorrow morn.\\!

\vin So, purposing each moment to retire,\\*
\vin She lingered still. Meantime, across the moors,\\
\vin Had come young \emph{Porphyro}, with heart on fire\\
\vin For \emph{Madeline}. Beside the portal doors,\\
\vin Buttressed from moonlight, stands he, and implores\\
\vin All saints to give him sight of \emph{Madeline},\\
\vin But for one moment in the tedious hours,\\
\vin That he might gaze \& worship all unseen;\\*
Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss -- in sooth such things have been.\\!

\vin He ventures in: let no buzzed whisper tell:\\*
\vin All eyes be muffled, or a 100 swords\\
\vin Will storm his heart, love's fev'rous citadel:\\
\vin For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes,\\
\vin Hyena foemen, \& hot-blooded lords,\\
\vin Whose very dogs would execrations howl\\
\vin Against his lineage: not one breast affords\\
\vin Him any mercy, in that mansion foul,\\*
Save one old beldame, weak in body \& in soul.\\!

\vin Ah -- happy chance! -- the ag\`ed creature came,\\*
\vin Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand,\\
\vin To where he stood, hid from the torch's flame,\\
\vin Behind a broad half-pillar, far beyond\\
\vin The sound of merriment \& chorus bland:\\
\vin He startled her; but soon she knew his face,\\
\vin And grasped his fingers in her palsied hand,\\
\vin Saying, `Mercy, \emph{Porphyro}! hie thee from this place;\\*
They are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!\\!

\vin `Get hence! Get hence! There's dwarfish \emph{Hildebrand};\\*
\vin He had a fever late, and in the fit\\
\vin He curs\`ed thee \& thine, both house \& land:\\
\vin Then there's that old Lord Maurice, not a whit\\
\vin More tame for his gray hairs -- Alas me! Flit!\\
\vin Flit like a ghost away.' `Ah, gossip dear,\\
\vin We're safe enough; here in this armchair sit,\\
\vin And tell me how' -- `Good saints! Not here, not here;\\*
Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier.'\\!

\vin He followed through a lowly arch\`ed way,\\*
\vin Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume,\\
\vin And as she muttered, `Well-aâ€”well-a-day!'\\
\vin He found him in a little moonlight room,\\
\vin Pale, latticed, chill, \& silent as a tomb.\\
\vin `Now tell me where is \emph{Madeline},' said he,\\
\vin `O tell me, \emph{Angela}, by the holy loom\\
\vin Which none but secret sisterhood may see,\\*
When they St \emph{Agnes}' wool are weaving piously.'\\!

\vin `St \emph{Agnes}! Ah! It is St \emph{Agnes}' Eve --\\*
\vin Yet men will murder upon holy days:\\
\vin Thou must hold water in a witch's sieve,\\
\vin And be liege-lord of all the elves \& fays,\\
\vin To venture so: it fills me with amaze\\
\vin To see thee, \emph{Porphyro}! St \emph{Agnes}' Eve!\\
\vin God's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays\\
\vin This very night: good angels her deceive!\\*
But let me laugh awhile, I've mickle time to grieve.'\\!

\vin Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,\\*
\vin While \emph{Porphyro} upon her face doth look,\\
\vin Like puzzled urchin on an ag\`ed crone\\
\vin Who keepeth closed a wond'rous riddle-book,\\
\vin As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.\\
\vin But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told\\
\vin His lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook\\
\vin Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold,\\*
And \emph{Madeline} asleep in lap of legends old.\\!

\vin Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,\\*
\vin Flushing his brow, and in his pain\`ed heart\\
\vin Made purple riot: then doth he propose\\
\vin A stratagem, that makes the beldame start:\\
\vin `A cruel man \& impious thou art:\\
\vin Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, \& dream\\
\vin Alone with her good angels, far apart\\
\vin From wicked men like thee. Go! Go! I deem\\*
Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.'\\!

\vin `I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,'\\*
\vin Quoth \emph{Porphyro}: `O may I ne'er find grace\\
\vin When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,\\
\vin If one of her soft ringlets I displace,\\
\vin Or look with ruffian passion in her face:\\
\vin Good \emph{Angela}, believe me by these tears;\\
\vin Or I will, even in a moment's space,\\
\vin Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears,\\*
And beard them, though they be more fanged than wolves \& bears.'\\!

\vin `Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?\\*
\vin A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,\\
\vin Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;\\
\vin Whose prayers for thee, each morn \& evening,\\
\vin Were never missed.' Thus plaining, doth she bring\\
\vin A gentler speech from burning \emph{Porphyro};\\
\vin So woful, and of such deep sorrowing,\\
\vin That \emph{Angela} gives promise she will do\\*
Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.\\!

\vin Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy,\\*
\vin Even to \emph{Madeline}'s chamber, and there hide\\
\vin Him in a closet, of such privacy\\
\vin That he might see her beauty unespyed,\\
\vin And win perhaps that night a peerless bride,\\
\vin While legioned faeries paced the coverlet,\\
\vin And pale enchantment held her sleepy-eyed.\\
\vin Never on such a night have lovers met,\\*
Since \emph{Merlin} paid his demon all the monstrous debt.\\!

\vin `It shall be as thou wishest,' said the dame:\\*
\vin `All cates \& dainties shall be stor\`ed there\\
\vin Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame\\
\vin Her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare,\\
\vin For I am slow \& feeble, and scarce dare\\
\vin On such a catering trust my dizzy head.\\
\vin Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer\\
\vin The while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed,\\*
Or may I never leave my grave among the dead.'\\!

\vin So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.\\*
\vin The lover's endless minutes slowly passed;\\
\vin The dame returned, and whispered in his ear\\
\vin To follow her; with ag\`ed eyes aghast\\
\vin From fright of dim espial. Safe at last,\\
\vin Through many a dusky gallery, they gain\\
\vin The maiden's chamber, silken, hushed, \& chaste;\\
\vin Where \emph{Porphyro} took covert, pleased amain.\\*
His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.\\!

\vin Her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade,\\*
\vin Old \emph{Angela} was feeling for the stair,\\
\vin When \emph{Madeline}, St \emph{Agnes}' charm\`ed maid,\\
\vin Rose, like a missioned spirit, unaware:\\
\vin With silver taper's light, \& pious care,\\
\vin She turned, and down the ag\`ed gossip led\\
\vin To a safe level matting. Now prepare,\\
\vin Young \emph{Porphyro}, for gazing on that bed;\\*
She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove frayed \& fled.\\!

\vin Out went the taper as she hurried in;\\*
\vin Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died:\\
\vin She closed the door, she panted, all akin\\
\vin To spirits of the air, \& visions wide:\\
\vin No uttered syllable, or, woe betide!\\
\vin But to her heart, her heart was voluble,\\
\vin Paining with eloquence her balmy side;\\
\vin As though a tongueless nightingale should swell\\*
Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell.\\!

\vin A casement high \& triple-arched there was,\\*
\vin All garlanded with carven imag'ries\\
\vin Of fruits, \& flowers, \& bunches of knot-grass,\\
\vin And diamonded with panes of quaint device,\\
\vin Innumerable of stains \& splendid dyes,\\
\vin As are the tiger-moth's deep-damasked wings;\\
\vin And in the midst, 'mong 1000 heraldries,\\
\vin And twilight saints, \& dim emblazonings,\\*
A shielded scutcheon blushed with blood of queens \& kings.\\!

\vin Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,\\*
\vin And threw warm gules on \emph{Madeline}'s fair breast,\\
\vin As down she knelt for heaven's grace \& boon;\\
\vin Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,\\
\vin And on her silver cross soft amethyst,\\
\vin And on her hair a glory, like a saint:\\
\vin She seemed a splendid angel, newly dressed,\\
\vin Save wings, for heaven: \emph{Porphyro} grew faint:\\*
She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.\\!

\vin Anon his heart revives: her vespers done,\\*
\vin Of all its wreath\`ed pearls her hair she frees;\\
\vin Unclasps her warm\`ed jewels one by one;\\
\vin Loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees\\
\vin Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees:\\
\vin Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed,\\
\vin Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,\\
\vin In fancy, fair St Agnes in her bed,\\*
But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.\\!

\vin Soon, trembling in her soft \& chilly nest,\\*
\vin In sort of wakeful swoon, perplexed she lay,\\
\vin Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppressed\\
\vin Her sooth\`ed limbs, \& soul fatigued away;\\
\vin Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;\\
\vin Blissfully havened both from joy \& pain;\\
\vin Clasped like a missal where swart paynims pray;\\
\vin Blinded alike from sunshine \& from rain,\\*
As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.\\!

\vin Stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced,\\*
\vin \emph{Porphyro} gazed upon her empty dress,\\
\vin And listened to her breathing, if it chanced\\
\vin To wake into a slumberous tenderness;\\
\vin Which when he heard, that minute did he bless,\\
\vin And breathed himself: then from the closet crept,\\
\vin Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,\\
\vin And over the hushed carpet, silent, stept,\\*
And 'tween the curtains peeped, where -- lo! -- how fast she slept.\\!

\vin Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon\\*
\vin Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set\\
\vin A table, and, \sfrac{1}{2} anguished, threw thereon\\
\vin A cloth of woven crimson, gold, \& jet:\\
\vin O for some drowsy morphean amulet!\\
\vin The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,\\
\vin The kettle-drum, \& far-heard clarinet,\\
\vin Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:\\*
The hall-door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.\\!

\vin And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,\\*
\vin In blanch\`ed linen, smooth, \& lavendered,\\
\vin While he forth from the closet brought a heap\\
\vin Of candied apple, quince, \& plum, \& gourd;\\
\vin With jellies soother than the creamy curd,\\
\vin And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;\\
\vin Manna \& dates, in argosy transferred\\
\vin From {\sc Fez}; \& spic\`ed dainties, every one,\\*
From silken {\sc Samarcand} to cedared Lebanon.\\!

\vin These delicates he heaped with glowing hand\\*
\vin On golden dishes \& in baskets bright\\
\vin Of wreath\`ed silver: sumptuous they stand\\
\vin In the retir\`ed quiet of the night,\\
\vin Filling the chilly room with perfume light.\\
\vin `And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!\\
\vin Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite:\\
\vin Open thine eyes, for meek St \emph{Agnes}' sake,\\*
Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.'\\!

\vin Thus whispering, his warm, unnerv\`ed arm\\*
\vin Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream\\
\vin By the dusk curtains:â€”'twas a midnight charm\\
\vin Impossible to melt as ic\`ed stream:\\
\vin The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam;\\
\vin Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies:\\
\vin It seemed he never, never could redeem\\
\vin From such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes;\\*
So mused awhile, entoiled in woof\`ed phantasies.\\!

\vin Awakening up, he took her hollow lute,\\*
\vin Tumultuous, and, in chords that tenderest be,\\ 
\vin He played an ancient ditty, long since mute,\\
\vin In Provence called, ``La belle dame sans mercy'':\\
\vin Close to her ear touching the melody;\\
\vin Wherewith disturbed, she uttered a soft moan:\\
\vin He ceased -- she panted quick -- and suddenly\\
\vin Her blue affray\`ed eyes wide open shone:\\*
Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone.\\!

\vin Her eyes were open, but she still beheld,\\*
\vin Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep:\\
\vin There was a painful change, that nigh expelled\\
\vin The blisses of her dream so pure \& deep\\
\vin At which fair \emph{Madeline} began to weep,\\
\vin And moan forth witless words with many a sigh;\\
\vin While still her gaze on \emph{Porphyro} would keep;\\
\vin Who knelt, with join\`ed hands \& piteous eye,\\*
Fearing to move or speak, she looked so dreamingly.\\!

\vin `Ah, \emph{Porphyro}!' said she, `But even now\\*
\vin Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,\\
\vin Made tuneable with every sweetest vow;\\
\vin And those sad eyes were spiritual \& clear:\\
\vin How changed thou art! how pallid, chill, \& drear!\\
\vin Give me that voice again, my \emph{Porphyro},\\
\vin Those looks immortal, those complainings dear!\\
\vin O leave me not in this eternal woe,\\*
For if thy diest, my love, I know not where to go.'\\!

\vin Beyond a mortal man impassioned far\\*
\vin At these voluptuous accents, he arose\\
\vin Ethereal, flushed, and like a throbbing star\\
\vin Seen 'mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose;\\
\vin Into her dream he melted, as the rose\\
\vin Blendeth its odour with the violet --\\
\vin Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows\\
\vin Like love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet\\*
Against the window-panes; St \emph{Agnes}' moon hath set.\\!

\vin 'Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet:\\*
\vin `This is no dream, my bride, my \emph{Madeline}!'\\
\vin 'Tis dark: the ic\`ed gusts still rave \& beat:\\
\vin `No dream, Alas! Alas! And woe is mine!\\
\vin \emph{Porphyro} will leave me here to fade \& pine.\\
\vin Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring?\\
\vin I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine,\\
\vin Though thou forsakest a deceiv\`ed thing;\\*
A dove forlorn \& lost with sick unprun\`ed wing.'\\!

\vin `My \emph{Madeline}! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!\\*
\vin Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest?\\
\vin Thy beauty's shield, heart-shaped \& vermeil-dyed?\\
\vin Ah silver shrine, here will I take my rest\\
\vin After so many hours of toil \& quest,\\
\vin A famished pilgrim, saved by miracle.\\
\vin Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest\\
\vin Saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well\\*
To trust, fair \emph{Madeline}, to no rude infidel.\\!

\vin `Hark! 'Tis an elfin-storm from faery land,\\*
\vin Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed:\\
\vin Arise! Arise! the morning is at hand;\\
\vin The bloated wassaillers will never heed:\\
\vin Let us away, my love, with happy speed;\\
\vin There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,\\
\vin Drowned all in rhenish \& the sleepy mead:\\
\vin Awake! Arise, my love, and fearless be,\\*
For o'er the southern moors I have a home for thee.'\\!

\vin She hurried at his words, beset with fears,\\*
\vin For there were sleeping dragons all around,\\
\vin At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears,\\
\vin Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.\\
\vin In all the house was heard no human sound.\\
\vin A chain-drooped lamp was flickering by each door;\\
\vin The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, \& hound,\\
\vin Fluttered in the besieging wind's uproar;\\*
And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.\\!

\vin They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall;\\*
\vin Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide;\\
\vin Where lay the porter, in uneasy sprawl,\\
\vin With a huge empty flaggon by his side:\\
\vin The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,\\
\vin But his sagacious eye an inmate owns:\\
\vin By one, \& one, the bolts full easy slide:\\
\vin The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;\\*
The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans.\\!

\vin And they are gone: ay, ages long ago\\*
\vin These lovers fled away into the storm.\\
\vin That night the baron dreamt of many a woe,\\
\vin And all his warrior-guests, with shade \& form\\
\vin Of witch, \& demon, \& large coffin-worm,\\
\vin Were long be-nightmared. \emph{Angela} the old\\
\vin Died palsy-twitched, with meagre face deform;\\
\vin The beadsman, after 1000 {\hge ave}s told,\\*
For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold.\\!
