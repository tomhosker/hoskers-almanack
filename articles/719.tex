By the sad waters of separation\footnotetext{`Exile', Ernest Dowson (1867 -- 1900). \cite{newlove}. The Almanackist has excised the third and fourth verses. Dowson dedicated this poem to the Anglo-Irish dramatist and novelist Conal Holmes O'Connell O'Riordan, who outlived him by almost a half-century.}\\*
\vin Where we have wandered by divers ways,\\
I have but the shadow \& imitation\\*
\vin Of the old memorial days.\\!

In music I have no consolation;\\*
\vin No roses are pale enough for me;\\
The sound of the waters of separation\\*
\vin Surpasseth roses \& melody.\\!

No man knoweth our desolation;\\*
\vin Memory pales of the old delight;\\
While the sad waters of separation\\*
\vin Bear us on to the ultimate night.
\end{verse}
