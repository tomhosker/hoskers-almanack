Everyone suddenly burst out singing;\footnotetext{`Everyone Sang', Siegfried Sassoon (1886 -- 1967). \cite{norton}.}\\*
And I was filled with such delight\\
As prisoned birds must find in freedom,\\
Winging wildly across the white\\*
Orchards and dark-green fields; on -- on -- and out of sight.\\!

Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted;\\*
And beauty came like the setting sun:\\
My heart was shaken with tears; and horror\\
Drifted away... O but everyone\\*
Was a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.
