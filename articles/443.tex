What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `Anthem for Doomed Youth', Wilfred Owen (1893 -- 1918). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Only the monstrous anger of the guns.\\
Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle\\
\vin Can patter out their hasty orisons.\\
No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells;\\
\vin Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,\\
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;\\*
\vin And bugles calling for them from sad shires.\\!

What candles may be held to speed them all?\\*
\vin Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes\\
\vin Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-bys.\\
The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;\\
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,\\*
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.
\end{verse}
