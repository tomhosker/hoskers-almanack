And if tonight my soul may find her peace\footnotetext{`Shadows', David Lawrence (1885 -- 1930). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. \P Larkin places the \emph{of} in the antepenultimate line in square brackets, presumably because of its absence in some manuscript from which the text is ultimately drawn.}\\*
In sleep, and sink in good oblivion,\\
And in the morning wake like a new-opened flower\\*
Then I have been dipped again in God, and new-created.\\!

And if, as weeks go round, in the dark of the moon\\*
My spirit darkens and goes out, and soft strange gloom\\
Pervades my movements \& my thoughts \& words\\
Then I shall know that I am walking still\\*
With God, we are close together now the moon's in shadow.\\!

And if, as autumn deepens \& darkens\\*
I feel the pain of falling leaves, and stems that break in storms\\
And trouble \& dissolution \& distress\\
And then the softness of deep shadows folding,\\
Folding around my soul \& spirit, around my lips\\
So sweet, like a swoon, or more like the drowse of a low, sad song\\
Singing darker than the nightingale, on, on to the solstice\\
And the silence of short days, the silence of the year, the shadow,\\
Then I shall know that my life is moving still\\
With the dark earth, and drenched\\*
With the deep oblivion of earth's lapse \& renewal.\\!

And if, in the changing phases of man's life,\\*
I fall in sickness \& in misery;\\
My wrists seem broken and my heart seems dead\\
And strength is gone, and my life\\*
Is only the leavings of a life:\\!

And still, among it all, snatches of lovely oblivion, and snatches\\*
Of renewal\\
Odd, wintry flowers upon the withered stem, yet new, strange flowers\\*
Such as my life has not brought forth before, new blossoms of me\\!

Then I must know that still\\*
I am in the hands of the unknown God;\\
He is breaking me down to his own oblivion\\*
To send me forth on a new morning, a new man.
