\poemlines{5}
My truelove hath my heart, and I have his,\footnotetext{`A Ditty', Sir Philip Sidney (1554 -- 1556). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
By just exchange one to the other given:\\
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss,\\
There never was a better bargain driven:\\*
\vin My truelove hath my heart, and I have his.\\!

His heart in me keeps him \& me in one,\\*
My heart in him his thoughts \& senses guides:\\
He loves my heart, for once it was his own,\\
I cherish his because in me it bides:\\*
\vin My truelove hath my heart, and I have his.
