Bid me to live, and I will live\footnotetext{$\xi$ `To Anthea, who may command him any thing', Rev Robert Herrick (1591 -- 1674). \cite{obev}.}\\*
\vin Thy protestant to be;\\
Or bid me love, and I will give\\*
\vin A loving heart to thee.\\!

A heart as soft, a heart as kind,\\*
\vin A heart as sound \& free,\\
As in the whole world thou canst find,\\*
\vin That heart I'll give to thee.\\!

Bid that heart stay, and it will stay,\\*
\vin To honour thy decree;\\
Or bid it languish quite away,\\*
\vin And 't shall do so for thee.\\!

Bid me to weep, and I will weep,\\*
\vin While I have eyes to see;\\
And having none, yet I will keep\\*
\vin A heart to weep for thee.\\!

Bid me despair, and I'll despair,\\*
\vin Under that cypress tree;\\
Or bid me die, and I will dare\\*
\vin E'en death, to die for thee.\\!

Thou art my life, my love, my heart,\\*
\vin The very eyes of me;\\
And hast command of every part,\\*
\vin To live and die for thee.
