What says my brother? `Death is a fearful thing.'\footnotetext{$\xi$ William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{obev}. This is a dialogue between Isabella and Claudio from \emph{Measure for Measure}, III.1.}\\*
And sham\`ed life a hateful.\\
`Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;\\
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;\\
This sensible warm motion to become\\
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\\
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\\
In thrilling region of thick-ribb\`ed ice;\\
To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,\\
And blown with restless violence round about\\
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst\\
Of those that lawless \& incertain thought\\
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!\\
The weariest \& most loath\`ed worldly life\\
That age, ache, penury \& imprisonment\\
Can lay on nature is a paradise\\*
To what we fear of death.'
\end{verse}
