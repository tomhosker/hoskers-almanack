\poemlines{5}
In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour,\footnotetext{George Meredith (1828 -- 1909). \cite{newlove}. This is from Meredith's sequence about the breakdown of his first marriage, \emph{Modern Love}.}\\* 
\vin When, in the firelight steadily aglow,\\
\vin Joined slackly, we beheld the red chasm grow\\
Among the clicking coals. Our library-bower\\
That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat\\
\vin As lovers to whom time is whispering.\\
\vin From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:\\
The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.\\
Well knew we that life's greatest treasure lay\\
\vin With us, and of it was our talk. `Ah, yes!\\
\vin Love dies!' I said: I never thought it less.\\
She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.\\
Then when the fire domed blackening, I found\\
\vin Her cheek was salt against my kiss, and swift\\
\vin Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift:\\*
Now am I haunted by that taste, that sound.
