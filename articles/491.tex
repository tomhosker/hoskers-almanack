\poemlines{5}
After the fiercest pangs of hot desire,\footnotetext{Rev Richard Duke (1658 -- 1711). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin Between \emph{Panthea}'s rising breasts,\\
\vin His bending breast \emph{Philander} rests:\\
Though vanquished, yet unknowing to retire,\\
\vin Close hugs the charmer, and ashamed to yield,\\*
\vin Though he has lost the day, yet keeps the field.\\!

When with a sigh the fair \emph{Panthea} said,\\*
\vin `What pity 'tis, ye gods, that all\\
\vin The noblest warriors soonest fall!'\\
Then with a kiss he gently reared his head,\\
\vin Armed him again to fight, for nobly she\\*
\vin More loved the combat than the victory.\\!

But more enraged, for being beat before,\\*
\vin With all his strength he does prepare\\
\vin More fiercely to renew the war;\\
Nor ceased he till the noble prize he bore:\\
\vin Ev'n her much wondrous courage did surprise;\\*
\vin She hugs the dart that wounded her, \& dies.
