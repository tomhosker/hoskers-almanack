Tell me not here; it needs not saying,\footnotetext{Prof Alfred Housman (1859 -- 1936). \cite{ptmgmc}.}\\*
\vin What tune the enchantress plays\\
In aftermaths of soft september\\
\vin Or under blanching mays,\\
For she \& I were long acquainted\\*
\vin And I knew all her ways.\\!

On russet floors, by waters idle,\\*
\vin The pine lets fall its cone;\\
The cuckoo shouts all day at nothing\\
\vin In leafy dells alone;\\
And traveller's joy beguiles in autumn\\*
\vin Hearts that have lost their own.\\!

On acres of the seeded grasses\\*
\vin The changing burnish heaves;\\
Or marshalled under moons of harvest\\
\vin Stand still all night the sheaves;\\
Or beeches strip in storms for winter\\*
\vin And stain the wind with leaves.\\!

Possess, as I possessed a season,\\*
\vin The countries I resign,\\
Where over elmy plains the highway\\
\vin Would mount the hills and shine,\\
And full of shade the pillared forest\\*
\vin Would murmur and be mine.\\!

For nature, heartless, witless nature,\\*
\vin Will neither care nor know\\
What stranger's feet may find the meadow\\
\vin And trespass there and go,\\
Nor ask amid the dews of morning\\*
\vin If they are mine or no.
