Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest\footnotetext{William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
\vin Now is the time that face should form another;\\
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\\
\vin Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother,\\
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb\\ 
\vin Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\\
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb\\
\vin Of his self-love, to stop posterity?\\
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee\\
\vin Calls back the lovely april of her prime:\\
So thou through windows of thine age shall see\\
\vin Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.\\
But if thou live, remembered not to be,\\*
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
\end{verse}
