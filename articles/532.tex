\poemlines{5}
\vin Whilst \emph{Alexis} lay pressed\footnotetext{John Dryden, Poet Laureate (1631 -- 1700). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin In her arms he loved best,\\
With his hands round her neck, and his head on her breast,\\	
He found the fierce pleasure too hasty to stay,\\*
And his soul in the tempest just flying away.\\!

\vin When \emph{Celia} saw this,\\*
\vin With a sigh, and a kiss,\\
She cried, `O my dear, I am robbed of my bliss;\\
â€™Tis unkind to your love, and unfaithfully done,\\*
To leave me behind you, and die all alone.'\\!

\vin The youth, though in haste,\\*
\vin And breathing his last,\\
In pity died slowly, while she died more fast;\\
Till at length she cried, `Now, my dear, now let us go;\\*
Now die, my \emph{Alexis}, and I will die too.'\\!

\vin Thus entranced they did lie,\\*
\vin Till \emph{Alexis} did try\\
To recover new breath, that again he might die:\\
Then often they died; but the more they did so,\\*
The nymph died more quick, \& the shepherd more slow.
