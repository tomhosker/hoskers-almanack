Happy ye leaves when as those lily hands,\footnotetext{$\xi$ Edmund Spenser (1552 -- 1599). \cite{norton}. This is the first of Spenser's \emph{Amoretti}. \P The Helicon is a river in Greece, part of which runs underground. The women who murdered Orpheus attempted to wash their hands therein after their crime, but the water sank into the earth so as not to be stained with the poet's blood.}\\*
\vin Which hold my life in their dead doing might\\
Shall handle you and hold in love's soft bands,\\
\vin Like captives trembling at the victor's sight.\\
\vin And happy lines, on which with starry light,\\
\vin \vin Those lamping eyes will deign sometimes to look\\
\vin And read the sorrows of my dying sprite,\\
\vin \vin Written with tears in heart's close bleeding book.\\
And happy rhymes bathed in the sacred brook\\
\vin Of {\sc Helicon} whence she deriv\`ed is,\\
When ye behold that angel's bless\`ed look,\\
\vin My soul's long lack\`ed food, my heaven's bliss.\\
Leaves, lines \& rhymes, seek her to please alone,\\*
Whom if ye please, I care for other none.
