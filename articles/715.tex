\poemlines{5}
Alone at the shut of day was I,\footnotetext{`Out of Work', Kenneth Ashley (1887 -- ?). \cite{ptmgmc}.}\\*
With a star or two in a frost-clear sky,\\
\vin And the byre smell in the air.\\
I'd tramped the length \& breadth of the fen;\\
But never a farmer wanted men;\\*
\vin Naught doing anywhere.\\!

A great calm moon rose back of the mill,\\*
And I told myself it was God's will\\
\vin Who went hungry and who went fed.\\
I tried to whistle; I tried to be brave;\\
But the new-ploughed fields smelt dank as the grave;\\*
\vin And I wished I were dead.
