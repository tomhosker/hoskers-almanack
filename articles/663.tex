\poemlines{5}
While joy gave clouds the light of stars,\footnotetext{`The Villain', William Davies (1871 -- 1940). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\* 
\vin That beamed wher'er they looked;\\
And calves \& lambs had tottering knees,\\
\vin Excited, while they sucked;\\
While every bird enjoyed his song,\\
Without one thought of harm or wrong --
I turned my head and saw the wind,\\
\vin Not far from where I stood,\\
Dragging the corn by her golden hair,\\*
\vin Into a dark \& lonely wood.
\end{verse}
