\poemlines{5}
When you shall see me in the toils of time,\footnotetext{Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. This is the first sonnet from a short sequence, `She to Him'.}\\*
\vin My lauded beauties carried off from me,\\
My eyes no longer stars as in their prime,\\
\vin My name forgot of maiden fair \& free;\\
When, in your being, heart concedes to mind,\\
\vin And judgment, though you scarce its process know,\\
Recalls the excellencies I once enshrined,\\
\vin And you are irked that they have withered so;\\
Remembering mine the loss is, not the blame,\\
\vin That sportsman time but rears his brood to kill,\\
Knowing me in my soul the very same\\
\vin One who would die to spare you touch of ill,\\
Will you not grant to old affection's claim\\*
\vin The hand of friendship down life's sunless hill?
\end{verse}
