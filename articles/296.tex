There be many that say, Who will show us any good?\footnotetext{Psalm 4.6-8. \cite{kjv}.}\\
\vin {\hge LORD}, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.\\
Thou hast put gladness in my heart,\\
\vin More than in the time that their corn \& their wine increased.\\
I will both lay me down in peace, \& sleep:\\*
\vin For thou, {\hge LORD}, only makest me dwell in safety.
