`Good morning! Good morning!' the General said\footnotetext{`The General', Siegfried Sassoon (1886 -- 1967). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. \P Arras was the site of a battle between the British and German Empires in 1917, which resulted in some three hundred thousand casualties.}\\*
When we met him last week on our way to the line.\\
Now the soldiers he smiled at are most of 'em dead,\\
And we're cursing his staff for incompetent swine.\\
`He's a cheery old card,' grunted \emph{Harry} to \emph{Jack}\\*
As they slogged up to {\sc Arras} with rifle \& pack.\\!

But he did for them both by his plan of attack.
