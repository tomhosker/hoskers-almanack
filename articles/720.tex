Dark house, by which once more I stand\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
\vin Here in the long unlovely street,\\
\vin Doors, where my heart was used to beat\\*
So quickly, waiting for a hand,\\!

A hand that can be clasped no more --\\*
\vin Behold me, for I cannot sleep,\\
\vin And like a guilty thing I creep\\*
At earliest morning to the door.\\!

He is not here; but far away\\*
\vin The noise of life begins again,\\
\vin And ghastly through the drizzling rain\\*
On the bald street breaks the blank day.
\end{verse}
