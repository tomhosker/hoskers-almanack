Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,\footnotetext{`To Autumn', John Keats (1795 -- 1821). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;\\*
Conspiring with him how to load \& bless\\
\vin With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;\\
To bend with apples the mossed cottage-trees,\\
\vin And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\\
\vin \vin To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\\
\vin With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\\
And still more, later flowers for the bees,\\
Until they think warm days will never cease,\\*
\vin \vin For summer has o'er-brimmed their clammy cells.\\!

Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?\\*
\vin Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find\\
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,\\
\vin Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;\\
Or on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep,\\
\vin Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook\\
\vin \vin Spares the next swath and all its twin\`ed flowers:\\
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep\\
\vin Steady thy laden head across a brook;\\
\vin Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,\\*
\vin \vin Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.\\!

Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where are they?\\*
\vin Think not of them; thou hast thy music too,\\
While barr\`ed clouds bloom the soft-dying day,\\
\vin And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;\\
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn\\
\vin Among the river sallows, borne aloft\\
\vin \vin Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;\\
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;\\
\vin Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft\\
\vin The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;\\*
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
