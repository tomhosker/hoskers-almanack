And, as her silver body downward went,\footnotetext{$\xi$ Christopher Marlowe (1564 -- 1593). \cite{obev}. \P Erycina was the patron goddess of Eryx, an ancient Greek settlement in Sicily, whom the Romans identified with Venus; hence Marlowe uses Erycine as a synonym for the latter goddess.}\\*
With both her hands she made the bed a tent,\\
And in her own mind thought herself secure,\\
O'ercast with dim \& darksome coverture.\\
And now she lets him whisper in her ear,\\
Flatter, entreat, promise, protest and swear;\\
Yet ever, as he greedily assayed\\
To touch those dainties, she the harpy played,\\
And every limb did, as a soldier stout,\\
Defend the fort, and keep the foeman out.\\
For though the rising ivory mount he scaled,\\
Which is with azure circling lines empaled,\\
Much like a globe (a globe may I term this,\\
By which love sails to regions full of bliss)\\
Yet there with \emph{Sisyphus} he toiled in vain,\\
Till gentle parley did the truce obtain.\\
Wherein \emph{Leander} on her quivering breast\\
Breathless spoke something, and sighed out the rest;\\
Which so prevailed, as he with small ado\\
Enclosed her in his arms and kissed her too.\\
And every kiss to her was as a charm,\\
And to \emph{Leander} as a fresh alarm,\\
So that the truce was broke and she, alas,\\
(Poor silly maiden) at his mercy was.\\
Love is not full of pity (as men say)\\
But deaf \& cru\"el where he means to prey.\\
Even as a bird, which in our hands we wring,\\
Forth plungeth and oft flutters with her wing,\\
She trembling strove. This strife of hers (like that\\
Which made the world) another world begat\\
Of unknown joy. Treason was in her thought,\\
And cunningly to yield herself she sought.\\
Seeming not won, yet won she was at length.\\
In such wars women use but \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} their strength.\\
\emph{Leander} now, like theban \emph{Hercules},\\
Entered the orchard of th'\emph{Hesperides};\\
Whose fruit none rightly can describe but he\\
That pulls or shakes it from the golden tree.\\
And now she wished this night were never done,\\
And sighed to think upon th'approaching sun;\\
For much it grieved her that the bright daylight\\
Should know the pleasure of this blessed night,\\
And them, like \emph{Mars} \& \emph{Erycine}, display\\
Both in each other's arms chained as they lay.\\
Again, she knew not how to frame her look,\\
Or speak to him, who in a moment took\\
That which so long so charily she kept,\\
And fain by stealth away she would have crept,\\
And to some corner secretly have gone,\\
Leaving \emph{Leander} in the bed alone.\\
But as her naked feet were whipping out,\\
He on the sudden clinged her so about,\\
That, mermaid-like, unto the floor she slid.\\
One \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} appeared, the other \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} was hid.\\
Thus near the bed she blushing stood upright,\\
And from her countenance behold ye might\\
A kind of twilight break, which through the hair,\\
As from an orient cloud, glimpsed here \& there,\\
And round about the chamber this false morn\\
Brought forth the day before the day was born.\\
So \emph{Hero}'s ruddy cheek \emph{Hero} betrayed,\\*
And her all naked to his sight displayed.
