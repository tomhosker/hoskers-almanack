\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
As I walked down through {\sc Chatham Street},\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{spanning_the_years}.}\\*
\vin A fair maid I did meet.\\
She asked me to see her home;\\*
\vin She lived in {\sc Bleeker Street}.\\!

{\it And away, you santy,\\*
\vin My dear honey!\\
O you {\sc New York} girls,\\*
\vin Can't you dance the polka?}\\!

And when we got to {\sc Bleeker Street}\\*
\vin We stopped at 44:\\
Her mother \& her sister there\\*
\vin To meet her at the door.\\!

And when I got inside the house,\\*
\vin The drinks were passed around.\\
The liquor was so awful strong,\\*
\vin My head went round and round.\\!

And then we had another drink\\*
\vin Before we sat to eat.\\
The liquor was so awful strong,\\*
\vin I quickly fell asleep.\\!

When I awoke next morning,\\*
\vin I had an aching head.\\
There was I, \emph{Jack}, all alone,\\*
\vin Stark naked in my bed.\\!

My gold watch \& my pocketbook\\*
\vin And lady friend were gone.\\
And there was I \emph{Jack}, all alone,\\*
\vin Stark naked in my room.\\!

On looking round this little room,\\*
\vin There's nothing I could see\\
But a woman's shift \& apron\\*
\vin That were no use to me.\\!

With a flour barrel for a suit of clothes\\*
\vin Down {\sc Cherry Street} forlorn,\\
There \emph{Martin Churchill} took me in\\*
\vin And sent me round {\sc Cape Horn}.\\!

{\it And away, you santy,\\*
\vin My dear honey!\\
O you {\sc New York} girls,\\*
\vin Can't you dance the polka?}
