Now is the winter of our discontent\footnotetext{$\xi$ William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{obev}. These are the opening lines of \emph{Richard III}, spoken by the eponymous villain, who at this time is Duke of Gloucester. \P The sun in splendour was, with the white rose, one of the symbols of the House of York; there is also a pun here, since Edward IV, the man being praised, was the eldest surviving son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York.}\\*
Made glorious summer by this sun of \emph{York};\\
And all the clouds that loured upon our house\\
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\\
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\\
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\\
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\\
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\\
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;\\
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds\\
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\\
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\\
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\\
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\\
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\\
I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's majesty\\
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\\
I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,\\
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\\
Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time\\
Into this breathing world, scarce \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} made up,\\
And that so lamely \& unfashionable\\
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\\
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\\
Have no delight to pass away the time,\\
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun\\
And descant on mine own deformity:\\
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\\
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,\\
I am determined to prove a villain\\
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\\
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\\
By drunken prophecies, libels \& dreams,\\
To set my brother \emph{Clarence} and the King\\
In deadly hate the one against the other:\\
And if King \emph{Edward} be as true \& just\\
As I am subtle, false \& treacherous,\\
This day should \emph{Clarence} closely be mewed up,\\
About a prophecy, which says that \emph{G}\\
Of \emph{Edward}'s heirs the murderer shall be.\\*
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here \emph{Clarence} comes.
