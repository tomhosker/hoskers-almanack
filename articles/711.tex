\poemlines{5}
When men were all asleep the snow came flying,\footnotetext{`London Snow', Robert Bridges, Poet Laureate (1844 -- 1930). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
\vin In large white flakes falling on the city brown,\\
Stealthily \& perpetually settling \& loosely lying,\\
\vin Hushing the latest traffic of the drowsy town;\\
Deadening, muffling, stifling its murmurs failing;\\
\vin Lazily \& incessantly floating down \& down:\\
Silently sifting \& veiling road, roof \& railing;\\
\vin Hiding difference, making unevenness even,\\
Into angles \& crevices softly drifting \& sailing.\\
\vin All night it fell, and when full inches seven\\
It lay in the depth of its uncompacted lightness,\\
\vin The clouds blew off from a high \& frosty heaven;\\
And all woke earlier for the unaccustomed brightness\\
\vin Of the winter dawning, the strange unheavenly glare:\\
The eye marvelled -- marvelled at the dazzling whiteness;\\
\vin The ear hearkened to the stillness of the solemn air;\\
No sound of wheel rumbling nor of foot falling,\\
\vin And the busy morning cries came thin \& spare.\\
Then boys I heard, as they went to school, calling,\\
\vin They gathered up the crystal manna to freeze\\
Their tongues with tasting, their hands with snowballing;\\
\vin Or rioted in a drift, plunging up to the knees;\\
Or peering up from under the white-mossed wonder,\\
\vin `O look at the trees!' they cried, `O look at the trees!'\\
With lessened load a few carts creak and blunder,\\
\vin Following along the white deserted way,\\
A country company long dispersed asunder:\\
\vin When now already the sun, in pale display\\
Standing by {\sc Paul's} high dome, spread forth below\\
\vin His sparkling beams, and awoke the stir of the day.\\
For now doors open, and war is waged with the snow;\\
\vin And trains of sombre men, past tale of number,\\
Tread long brown paths, as toward their toil they go:\\
\vin But even for them awhile no cares encumber\\
Their minds diverted; the daily word is unspoken,\\
\vin The daily thoughts of labour \& sorrow slumber\\*
At the sight of the beauty that greets them, for the charm they have broken.
