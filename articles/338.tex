\begin{verse}
\poemlines{5}
But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the {\hge LORD} shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.\footnotetext{Micah 3.1-4. \cite{kjv}.}\\
And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the {\hge LORD}, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of {\sc Zion}, and the word of the {\hge LORD} from {\sc Jerusalem}.\\
And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\\
But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the {\hge LORD} of hosts hath spoken it.
