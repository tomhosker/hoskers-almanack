\poemlines{5}
Methought I saw my late espous\`ed saint\footnotetext{Sonnet 23, John Milton (1608 -- 1674). \cite{norton}. \P Alcestis was the wife of Admetus. Having given her life to ensure her husband's survival, Heracles broke into the underworld and returned her to her home.}\\*
\vin Brought to me, like \emph{Alcestis}, from the grave,\\
\vin Whom \emph{Jove}'s great son to her glad husband gave,\\
Rescued from death by force, though pale \& faint.\\
Mine, as whom washed from spot of child-bed taint\\
\vin Purification in the old law did save,\\
\vin And such as yet once more I trust to have\\
Full sight of her in heaven without restraint,\\
Came vested all in white, pure as her mind;\\
\vin Her face was veiled, yet to my fancied sight\\
Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\\
\vin So clear as in no face with more delight.\\
But O as to embrace me she inclined,\\*
\vin I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.
