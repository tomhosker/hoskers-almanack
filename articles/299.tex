\poemlines{5}
In the Lord put I my trust;\footnotetext{Psalm 11.1-5,7-8. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin How say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a bird unto the hill?\\
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the quiver,\\
\vin That they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.\\
If the foundations be destroyed,\\
\vin What hath the righteous done?\\
The Lord is in his holy temple;\\
\vin The Lord's seat is in heaven.\\
His eyes consider the poor,\\
\vin And his eyelids try the children of men.\\
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire \& brimstone, storm and tempest:\\
\vin This shall be their portion to drink.\\
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness;\\*
\vin His countenance will behold the thing that is just.
