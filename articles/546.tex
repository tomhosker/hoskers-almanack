\poemlines{5}
Now that the midday heat doth scorch my shame\footnotetext{`Ego Sum Vitis', Rev Dr William Alabaster (1568 -- 1640). \cite{obev}.}\\*
With lightning of fond lust, I will retire\\
Under this vine whose arms with wandering spire\\
Do climb upon the cross, and on the same\\
Devise a cool repose from lawless flame,\\
Whose leaves are intertwist with love entire,\\
That envy's eye cannot transfuse her fire,\\
But is rebated on the shady frame;\\
And youthful vigour from the leav\`ed tier,\\
Doth stream upon my soul a new desire.\\
List, list, the ditties of sublim\`ed fame,\\
Which in the closet of those leaves the choir\\
Of heavenly birds do warble to his name.\\*
Or where was I that was not where I am?
