My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.  When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and slates jutted off here \& there, beyond the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.\footnotetext{Miss Emily Bront\"e (1818 -- 1848). \cite{wuthering}.}

I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the moor: the middle one grey, and \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} buried in the heath; \emph{Edgar Linton}'s only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; \emph{Heathcliff}'s still bare.

I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath \& harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
