\poemlines{5}
He paused on the sill of a door ajar\footnotetext{`The Newcomer's Wife', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
That screened a lively liquor-bar,\\
For the name had reached him through the door\\*
Of her he had married the week before.\\!

`We called her the Hack of the Parade;\\*
But she was discreet in the games she played;\\
If slightly worn, she's pretty yet,\\*
And gossips, after all, forget.\\!

`And he knows nothing of her past;\\*
I am glad the girl's in luck at last;\\
Such ones, though stale to native eyes,\\*
Newcomers snatch at as a prize.'\\!

`Yes, being a stranger he sees her blent\\*
Of all that's fresh \& innocent,\\
Nor dreams how many a love-campaign\\*
She had enjoyed before his reign!'\\!

That night there was the splash of a fall\\*
Over the slimy harbour-wall:\\
They searched, and at the deepest place\\*
Found him with crabs upon his face.
