\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
The snow falls deep; the forest lies alone:\footnotetext{`Gypsies', John Clare (1793 -- 1864). \cite{norton}.}\\*
The boy goes hasty for his load of brakes,\\
Then thinks upon the fire and hurries back;\\
The gypsy knocks his hands and tucks them up,\\
And seeks his squalid camp, \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} hid in snow,\\
Beneath the oak, which breaks away the wind,\\
And bushes close, with snow like hovel warm:\\
There stinking mutton roasts upon the coals,\\
And the \sfrac{$1$}{$2$}-roasted dog squats close and rubs,\\
Then feels the heat too strong and goes aloof;\\
He watches well, but none a bit can spare,\\
And vainly waits the morsel thrown away:\\
'Tis thus they live -- a picture to the place;\\*
A quiet, pilfering, unprotected race.
\end{verse}
