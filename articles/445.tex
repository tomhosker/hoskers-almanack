\poemlines{5}
When the present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay, \footnotetext{`Afterwards', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin And the may month flaps its glad green leaves like wings,\\
Delicate-filmed as new-spun silk, will the neighbours say,\\*
\vin `He was a man who used to notice such things'?\\!

If it be in the dusk when, like an eyelid's soundless blink,\\*
\vin The dewfall-hawk comes crossing the shades to alight\\
Upon the wind-warped upland thorn, a gazer may think,\\*
\vin `To him this must have been a familiar sight.'\\!

If I pass during some nocturnal blackness, mothy \& warm,\\*
\vin When the hedgehog travels furtively over the lawn,\\
One may say, `He strove that such innocent creatures should come to no harm,\\*
\vin But he could do little for them; and now he is gone.'\\!

If, when hearing that I have been stilled at last, they stand at the door,\\*
\vin Watching the full-starred heavens that winter sees,\\
Will this thought rise on those who will meet my face no more,\\*
\vin `He was one who had an eye for such mysteries'?\\!

And will any say when my bell of quittance is heard in the gloom,\\*
\vin And a crossing breeze cuts a pause in its outrollings,\\
Till they rise again, as they were a new bell's boom,\\*
\vin `He hears it not now, but used to notice such things'?
