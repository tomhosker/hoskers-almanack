\vin \vin \vin Yes, contumelious fair, you scorn\footnotetext{`The Author Apologizes to a Lady for His Being a Little Man', Christopher Smart (1722 -- 1771). \cite{newlove}. Smart affixed two quotations to this poem: one from the \guillemotleft{\greektext >Ili'as}\guillemotright -- `{\greektext Oligon te filon te}', which means, ``A small but dear thing'' -- and one from Pliny's \emph{Naturalis Historia} -- `Natura nusquam magis, quam in minimis tota est', which means ``Nature is nowhere greater than in the smallest of things''.}\\*
\vin The amorous dwarf, that courts you to his arms,\\
\vin \vin \vin But ere you leave him quite forlorn,\\
\vin \vin And to some youth gigantic yield your charms,\\
\vin Hear him, O hear him, if you will not try,\\*
And let your judgment check th'ambition of your eye.\\!

\vin \vin \vin Say, is it carnage makes the man?\\*
\vin Is to be monstrous really to be great?\\
\vin \vin \vin Say, is it wise or just to scan\\
\vin \vin Your lover's worth by quantity, or weight?\\
\vin Ask your mamma \& nurse, if it be so;\\*
Nurse \& mamma, I ween, shall jointly answer, no.\\!

\vin \vin \vin The less the body to the view,\\*
\vin The soul (like springs in closer durance pent)\\
\vin \vin \vin Is all exertion, ever new,\\
\vin \vin Unceasing, unextinguished, and unspent;\\
\vin Still pouring forth executive desire,\\*
As bright, as brisk, \& lasting, as the vestal fire.\\!

\vin \vin \vin Does thy young bosom pant for fame?\\*
\vin Would'st thou be of posterity the toast?\\
\vin \vin \vin The poets shall ensure thy name,\\
\vin \vin Who magnitude of mind not body boast.\\
\vin Laurels on bulky bards as rarely grow,\\*
As on the sturdy oak the virtuous misletoe.\\!

\vin \vin \vin Look in the glass, survey that cheek\\*
\vin Where \emph{Flora} has with all her roses blushed;\\
\vin \vin \vin The shape so tender, looks so meek,\\
\vin \vin The breasts made to be pressed, not to be crushed --\\
\vin Then turn to me -- turn with obliging eyes,\\*
Nor longer nature's works, in miniature, despise.\\!

\vin \vin \vin Young \emph{Ammon} did the world subdue,\\*
\vin Yet had not more external man than I;\\
\vin \vin \vin Ah charmer, should I conquer you,\\
\vin \vin With him in fame, as well as size, I'll vie.\\
\vin Then, scornful nymph, come forth to yonder grove,\\*
Where I defy, and challenge, all thy utmost love.
