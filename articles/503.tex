\poemlines{5}
He carved besides a soft and fruitful field,\footnotetext{$\xi$ George Chapman (?1559 -- 1634). \cite{obev}. This is a translation of Homer's {\greektext >Ili'as}, Book XVIII, lines 541-592. Prof Auden wrote his own poem (`The Shield of Achilles') concerning the same portion of Book XVIII.}\\*
Broad \& thrice new-tilled in that heavenly shield,\\
Where many ploughmen turned up here \& there\\
The earth in furrows, and their sovereign near\\
They strived to work; and every furrow ended\\
A bowl of sweetest wine he still extended\\
To him that first had done, then turned they hand,\\
Desirous to dispatch that piece of land,\\
Deep \& new-eared; black grew the plough with mould\\
Which looked like blackish earth though forged of gold.\\
And this he did with miracle adorn.\\
Then made he grow a field of high-sprung corn,\\
In which did reapers sharpened sickles ply;\\
Others, their handles fall'n confusedly,\\
Laid on the ridge together; others bound\\
Their gathered handfuls to sheaves hard \& round.\\
Their binders were appointed for the place,\\
And at their heels did children glean apace,\\
Whole armfuls to the binders ministering.\\
Amongst all these all silent stood their king.\\
Upon a balk, his sceptre in his hand,\\
Glad at his heart to see his yieldy land.\\
The heralds then the harvest feast prepare,\\
Beneath an oak far off, and for their fare,\\
A mighty ox was slain, and women dressed\\
Store of white cakes, and mixed the labourers' feast\\
In it besides a vine ye might behold\\
Loaded with grapes, the leaves were all of gold.\\
The bunches black \& thick did through it grow\\
And silver props sustained them from below:\\
About the vine an azure dyke was wrought\\
And about it a hedge of tin he brought.\\
One path went through it, through the which did pass\\
The vintagers, when ripe their vintage was.\\
The virgins then, \& youths, childishly wise,\\
For the sweet fruit did painted cups devise,\\
And in a circle bore them dancing round,\\
In midst whereof a boy did sweetly sound\\
His silver harp, and with a piercing voice,\\
Sung a sweet song; when each youth with his choice\\
Triumphing over earth, quick dances treads.\\
A herd of oxen thrusting out their heads\\
And bellowing, from their stalls rushing to feed\\
Near a swift flood, raging and crowned with reed,\\ 
In gold and tin he carv\`ed next the vine\\
Four golden herdsmen following: herd-dogs nine\\
Waiting on them; in head of all the herd,\\
Two lions shook a bull, that bellowing, reared\\
In desperate horror, and was dragged away:\\
The dogs \& youths pursued; but their slain prey,\\
The lions rent out of his spacious hide,\\
And in their entrails did his flesh divide,\\
Lapping his sable blood; the men to fight\\
Set on their dogs in vain that durst not bite,\\
But barked \& backwards flew: he forged beside\\
In a fair vale, a pasture sweet \& wide\\
Of white-fleeced sheep, in which he did impress\\
Sheepcots, sheepfolds \& covered cottages.\\
In this rare shield the famous \emph{Vulcan} cast\\
A dancing mace; like that in ages past,\\
Which in broad {\sc Knossos} \emph{Daedalus} did dress\\*
For \emph{Ariadne} with the golden tress.
