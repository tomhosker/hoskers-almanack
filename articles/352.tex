\poemlines{5}
Behold, I will make {\sc Jerusalem} a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against {\sc Jerusalem}.\footnotetext{Zecheriah 12, 13.1, 14.1-12. \cite{kjv}.}\\
And in that day will I make {\sc Jerusalem} a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.\\
In that day, saith the {\hge LORD}, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.\\
And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of {\sc Jerusalem} shall be my strength in the {\hge LORD} of hosts their God.\\
In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand \& on the left: and {\sc Jerusalem} shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in {\sc Jerusalem}.\\
The {\hge LORD} also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of \emph{David} and the glory of the inhabitants of {\sc Jerusalem} do not magnify themselves against Judah.\\
In that day shall the {\hge LORD} defend the inhabitants of {\sc Jerusalem}; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as \emph{David}; and the house of \emph{David} shall be as God, as the angel of the {\hge LORD} before them.\\
And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against {\sc Jerusalem}.\\
And I will pour upon the house of \emph{David}, and upon the inhabitants of {\sc Jerusalem}, the spirit of grace \& of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.\\
In that day shall there be a great mourning in {\sc Jerusalem}, as the mourning of {\sc Hadadrimmon} in the valley of {\sc Megiddon}.\\
And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of \emph{David} apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of \emph{Nathan} apart, and their wives apart;\\
The family of the house of \emph{Levi} apart, and their wives apart; the family of \emph{Shimei} apart, and their wives apart;\\
All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.\\!

Behold, the day of the {\hge LORD} cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.\\
For I will gather all nations against {\sc Jerusalem} to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.\\
Then shall the {\hge LORD} go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.\\
And his feet shall stand in that day upon the {\sc Mount of Olives}, which is before {\sc Jerusalem} on the east, and the {\sc Mount of Olives} shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.\\
And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto {\sc Azal}: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of \emph{Uzziah}, King of Judah: and the {\hge LORD} my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.\\
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:\\
But it shall be one day which shall be known to the {\hge LORD}, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.\
And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from {\sc Jerusalem}; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.\\
And the {\hge LORD} shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one {\hge LORD}, and his name one.\\
All the land shall be turned as a plain from {\sc Geba} to {\sc Rimmon} south of {\sc Jerusalem}: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from {\sc Benjamin's Gate} unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the {\sc Tower of Hananeel} unto the king's winepresses.\\
And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but {\sc Jerusalem} shall be safely inhabited.\\
And this shall be the plague wherewith the {\hge LORD} will smite all the people that have fought against {\sc Jerusalem}; their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
