All things within this fading world hath end,\footnotetext{`Before the Birth of One of Her Children', Mrs Anne Bradstreet (?1612 -- 1672). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Adversity doth still our joys attend;\\
No ties so strong, no friends so dear \& sweet,\\
But with death's parting blow is sure to meet.\\
The sentence past is most irrevocable,\\
A common thing, yet O inevitable.\\
How soon, my dear, death may my steps attend\\  
How soon't may be thy lot to lose thy friend,\\
We are both ignorant, yet love bids me\\
These farewell lines to recommend to thee,\\
That when that knot's untied that made us one,\\
I may seem thine, who in effect am none.\\
And if I see not \sfrac{1}{2} my days that's due,\\
What nature would, God grant to yours and you;\\
The many faults that well you know I have\\
Let be interred in my oblivious grave;\\
If any worth or virtue were in me,\\
Let that live freshly in thy memory\\
And when thou feel'st no grief, as I no harms,\\
Yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms.\\
And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains,\\
Look to my little babes, my dear remains.\\
And if thou love thyself, or loved'st me,\\
These O protect from step-dames' injury.\\
And if chance to thine eyes shall bring this verse,\\
With some sad sighs honour my absent hearse;\\
And kiss this paper for thy loves dear sake,\\*
Who with salt tears this last farewell did take.
