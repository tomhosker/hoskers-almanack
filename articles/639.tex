She stood breast-high amid the corn,\footnotetext{`Ruth', Thomas Hood (1799 -- 1845). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
Clasped by the golden light of morn,\\
Like the sweetheart of the sun,\\*
Who many a glowing kiss had won.\\!

On her cheek an autumn flush,\\*
Deeply ripened; such a blush\\
In the midst of brown was born,\\*
Like red poppies grown with corn.\\!

Round her eyes her tresses fell;\\*
Which were blackest none could tell,\\
But long lashes veiled a light,\\*
That had else been all too bright.\\!

And her hat, with shady brim,\\*
Made her tressy forehead dim;\\
Thus she stood amid the stooks,\\*
Praising God with sweetest looks:\\!

Sure, I said, heaven did not mean,\\*
Where I reap thou shouldst but glean;\\
Lay thy sheaf adown and come,\\*
Share my harvest \& my home.
\end{verse}
