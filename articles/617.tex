With wine \& words of love \& every vow\footnotetext{`Seduced Girl', Louis Untermeyer, Poet Laureate of the United States (1885 -- 1978). \cite{newlove}. This is a translation of a poem by Hedylus, a Greek poet of the Alexandrian school.}\\*
\vin He lulled me into bed and closed my eyes,\\
A sleepy, stupid innocent... So now\\
\vin I dedicate the spoils of my surprise:\\
The silk that bound my breasts, my virgin zone,\\
\vin The cherished purity I could not keep.\\
Goddess, remember we were all alone,\\*
\vin And he was strong, and I was \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} asleep.
