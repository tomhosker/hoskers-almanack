\poemlines{5}
When icicles hang by the wall,\footnotetext{$\xi$ William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{obev}. This song is sung in \emph{Love's Labours Lost} V.2. \P Blowing one's nail means breathing on one's hands to warm them up. \P The parson's saw is more likely his sermon than an implement for cutting wood; likewise the crabs hissing in the bowl are more likely crab apples than sea creatures.}\\*
\vin And \emph{Dick} the shepherd blows his nail,\\
And \emph{Tom} bears logs into the hall,\\
\vin And milk comes frozen home in pail,\\
When blood is nipped and ways be foul,\\
Then nightly sings the staring owl,\\
\vin \vin Tu-whit;\\
\vin \vin Tu-who, a merry note,\\*
While greasy \emph{Joan} doth keel the pot.\\!

When all aloud the wind doth blow,\\*
\vin And coughing drowns the parson's saw,\\
And birds sit brooding in the snow,\\
\vin And \emph{Marian}'s nose looks red \& raw,\\
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,\\
Then nightly sings the staring owl,\\
\vin \vin Tu-whit;\\
\vin \vin Tu-who, a merry note,\\*
While greasy \emph{Joan} doth keel the pot.
