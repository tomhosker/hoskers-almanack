Ancient person, for whom I\footnotetext{`A Song of a Young Lady to Her Ancient Lover', John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester (1647 -- 1680). \cite{newlove}. \P Other sources give `heart' instead of `heat' in the tenth line and `their' for `his' in the eighteenth.}\\*
All the flattering youth defy,\\
Long be it ere thou grow old,\\
Aching, shaking, crazy, cold;\\
\vin But still continue as thou art,\\*
\vin Ancient person of my heart.\\!

On thy withered lips \& dry,\\*
Which like barren furrows lie,\\
Brooding kisses I will pour\\
Shall thy youthful heat restore\\
(Such kind showers in autumn fall,\\
And a second spring recall);\\
\vin Nor from thee will ever part,\\*
\vin Ancient person of my heart.\\!

Thy nobler part, which but to name\\*
In our sex would be counted shame,\\
By age's frozen grasp possessed,\\
From his ice shall be released,\\
And soothed by my reviving hand,\\
In former warmth \& vigour stand.\\
All a lover's wish can reach\\
For thy joy my love shall teach,\\
And for they pleasure shall improve\\
All that art can add to love.\\
\vin Yet still I love thee without art,\\*
\vin Ancient person of my heart.
