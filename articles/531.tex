\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
When she rises in the morning\footnotetext{David Lawrence (1885 -- 1930). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
I linger to watch her;\\
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window\\
And the sunbeams catch her\\
Glistening white on the shoulders,\\
While down her sides the mellow\\
Golden shadow glows as\\
She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts\\
Sway like full-blown yellow\\*
Gloire de Dijon roses.\\!

She drips herself with water, and her shoulders\\*
Glisten as silver, they crumple up\\
Like wet \& falling roses, and I listen\\
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.\\
In the window full of sunlight\\
Concentrates her golden shadow\\
Fold on fold, until it glows as\\*
Mellow as the glory roses.
\end{verse}
