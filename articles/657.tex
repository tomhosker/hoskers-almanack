Praise him that aye\footnotetext{$\xi$ Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke, Baroness Herbert of Cardiff (1561 -- 1621). \cite{obev}. This is a translation of Psalm 117. In Lady Pembroke's time, the letter E was sometimes omitted when spelling the word \emph{praise}.}\\*
Remains the same:\\
All tongues display\\
\emph{Iehova}'s fame.\\
Sing all that share\\
This earthly ball:\\
His mercies are\\
Exposed to all.\\
Like as the word\\
Once he doth give,\\
Rolled in rec\'ord,\\*
Doth time outlive.
\end{verse}
