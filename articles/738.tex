So we'll go no more a roving\footnotetext{George Noel, 5th Baron Byron (1788 -- 1824). \cite{norton}. Here Lord Byron is codifying, in a manner not dissimilar to Burns, an ancient English folk song, known in one of its variations as `The Maid of Amsterdam'.}\\*
\vin So late into the night,\\
Though the heart be still as loving,\\*
\vin And the moon be still as bright.\\!

For the sword outwears its sheath,\\*
\vin And the soul wears out the breast,\\
And the heart must pause to breathe,\\*
\vin And love itself have rest.\\!

Though the night was made for loving,\\*
\vin And the day returns too soon,\\
Yet we'll go no more a roving\\*
\vin By the light of the moon.
