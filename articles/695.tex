\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
She lay all naked in her bed,\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin And I myself lay by;\\
No veil but curtains about her spread,\\
\vin No covering but I:\\
Her head upon her shoulders seeks\\
\vin To hang in careless wise,\\
And full of blushes was her cheeks,\\*
\vin And of wishes were her eyes.\\!

Her blood still fresh into her face,\\*
\vin As on a message came,\\
To say that in another place\\
\vin It meant another game;\\
Her cherry lip moist, plump \& fair,\\
\vin Millions of kisses crown,\\
Which ripe \& uncropped dangle there,\\*
\vin And weigh the branches down.\\!

Her breasts, that welled so plump \& high,\\*
\vin Bred pleasant pain in me;\\
For all the world I do defy\\
\vin The like felicity;\\
Her thighs \& belly, soft \& fair,\\
\vin To me were only shown:\\
To have seen such meat, and not to have eat,\\*
\vin Would have angered any stone.\\!

Her knees lay upward gently bent,\\*
\vin And all lay hollow under,\\
As if on easy terms, they meant\\
\vin To fall unforced asunder;\\
Just so the cyprian queen did lie,\\
\vin Expecting in her bower;\\
When too long stay had kept the boy\\*
\vin Beyond his promised hour.\\!

`Dull clown,' quoth she; `why dost delay\\*
\vin Such proffered bliss to take?\\
Canst thou find out no other way\\
\vin Similitudes to make?'\\
Mad with delight I thundering\\
\vin Throw my arms about her,\\
But -- pox upon't -- 'twas but a dream;\\*
\vin And so I lay without her.
