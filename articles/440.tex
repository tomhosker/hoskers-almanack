\poemlines{5}
I look into my glass\footnotetext{Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin And view my wasting skin,\\
And say, `Would God it came to pass\\*
\vin My heart had shrunk as thin!'\\!

For then, I, undistressed\\*
\vin By hearts grown cold to me,\\
Could lonely wait my endless rest\\*
\vin With equanimity.\\!

But time, to make me grieve,\\*
\vin Part steals, lets part abide;\\
And shakes this fragile frame at eve\\*
\vin With throbbings of noontide.
\end{verse}
