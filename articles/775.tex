\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
There were once two irish labouring men; to England they came over;\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{old_england2}.}\\*
And they tramped about in search of work from {\sc Liverpool} to {\sc Dover}.\\
Says \emph{Mike} to \emph{Pat}, `I'm tired of this. We're both left in the lurch,\\
And if I don't get work, bedad, I'll go and rob a church.'\\
`What, rob a church!' says \emph{Pat} to \emph{Mike}; `How could you be so vile?\\
For something sure would happen while we're going down the aisle.\\
But if you do, I'll go with you, and we'll get safe out, I hope.'\\*
So, listen and I'll tell you now how \emph{Paddy} stole the rope.\\!

Well off they went with theft intent to the place they wanted finding,\\*
And they broke inside of a country church where nobody was minding.\\
And they scraped together all they could, they were prepared to slope,\\
When \emph{Paddy} says, `Now hold on, \emph{Mike}. What have we got for rope?\\
For we have no bag to hold our swag, and before we get outside,\\
With something strong \& stout, my lad, this bundle must be tied.'\\
And just then he spied the church bell rope, and before you could turn about,\\*
He did ride up the belfry high to climb that rope so stout.\\!

And holding on by one hand \& leg, he pulled his clasp knife out,\\*
And right above his hand \& head he cut that rope so stout.\\
Well he quite forgot it held him up, and, by the holy Pope,\\
Down to the bottom of the church fell Paddy and the rope.\\
`Come out of that,' says \emph{Mike} to \emph{Pat}, `and will you stop your moaning,\\
`If that's the way you steal a rope, it's no wonder that you're groaning.\\
I'll show you how to steal the rope, if you lend to me your knife.'\\*
`O \emph{Mike}, go easy,' says old \emph{Pat}, `or else you'll lose your life.'\\!

So \emph{Mike} climbed up the other rope, just like an antelope,\\*
But instead of cutting it off above, he cut it off below.\\
Down fell the other piece of rope, and \emph{Mike} was left on high.\\
`Come down,' says \emph{Pat}. `I can't,' says \emph{Mick}, `for if I drop, I'll die.'\\
Well their noise it brought the beagles out, the sexton \& police,\\
And though they got poor \emph{Micky} down, they spared them no release.\\
And for their ingenuity they have now a wider scope\\*
Than when they broke inside a church to go and steal the rope.\\!
