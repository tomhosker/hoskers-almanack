\poemlines{5}
Calm is the morn without a sound,\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Calm as to suit a calmer grief,\\
\vin And only through the faded leaf,\\*
The chestnut pattering to the ground:\\!

Calm \& deep peace on this high wold,\\*
\vin And on these dews that drench the furze.\\
\vin And all the silvery gossamers\\*
That twinkle into green \& gold:\\!

Calm \& still light on yon great plain\\*
\vin That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,\\
\vin And crowded farms \& lessening towers,\\*
To mingle with the bounding main:\\!

Calm \& deep peace in this wide air,\\*
\vin These leaves that redden to the fall;\\
\vin And in my heart, if calm at all,\\*
If any calm, a calm despair:\\!

Calm on the seas, \& silver sleep,\\*
\vin And waves that sway themselves in rest,\\
\vin And dead calm in that noble breast\\*
Which heaves but with the heaving deep.\\!
