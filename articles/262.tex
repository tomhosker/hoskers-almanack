Here is the place; right over the hill\footnotetext{`Telling the Bees', John Whittier (1807 -- 1882). \cite{norton}. It is ancient custom for a beekeeper to tell his bees of significant events in his life, for fear that they might otherwise migrate.}\\*
\vin Runs the path I took;\\
You can see the gap in the old wall still,\\*
\vin And the stepping-stones in the shallow brook.\\!

There is the house, with the gate red-barred,\\*
\vin And the poplars tall;\\
And the barn's brown length, and the cattle-yard,\\*
\vin And the white horns tossing above the wall.\\!

There are the beehives ranged in the sun;\\*
\vin And down by the brink\\
Of the brook are her poor flowers, weed-o'errun,\\*
\vin Pansy and daffodil, rose and pink.\\!

A year has gone, as the tortoise goes,\\*
\vin Heavy \& slow;\\
And the same rose blows, and the same sun glows,\\*
\vin And the same brook sings of a year ago.\\!

There's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze;\\*
\vin And the june sun warm\\
Tangles his wings of fire in the trees,\\*
\vin Setting, as then, over {\sc Fernside} farm.\\!

I mind me how with a lover's care\\*
\vin From my sunday coat\\
I brushed off the burrs, and smoothed my hair,\\*
\vin And cooled at the brookside my brow and throat.\\!

Since we parted, a month had passed --\\*
\vin To love, a year;\\
Down through the beeches I looked at last\\*
\vin On the little red gate and the well-sweep near.\\!

I can see it all now: the slantwise rain\\*
\vin Of light through the leaves,\\
The sundownâ€™s blaze on her window-pane,\\* 
\vin The bloom of her roses under the eaves.\\!

Just the same as a month before,\\*
\vin The house and the trees,\\
The barn's brown gable, the vine by the door,\\*
\vin Nothing changed but the hives of bees.\\!

Before them, under the garden wall,\\*
\vin Forward \& back,\\
Went drearily singing the chore-girl small,\\*
\vin Draping each hive with a shred of black.\\!

Trembling, I listened: the summer sun\\*
\vin Had the chill of snow;\\
For I knew she was telling the bees of one\\*
\vin Gone on the journey we all must go!\\!

Then I said to myself, `My \emph{Mary} weeps\\* 
\vin For the dead today:\\
Haply her blind old grandsire sleeps\\*
\vin The fret and the pain of his age away.'\\!

But her dog whined low; on the doorway sill,\\*
\vin With his cane to his chin,\\
The old man sat; and the chore-girl still\\*
\vin Sung to the bees stealing out and in.\\!

And the song she was singing ever since\\*
\vin In my ear sounds on:\\
`Stay at home, pretty bees; fly not hence!\\*
\vin Mistress \emph{Mary} is dead \& gone!'\\!
