How should I your true love know\footnotetext{`An Old Song Ended', Gabriel Rossetti (1828 -- 1882). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin From another one?\\
`By his cockle-hat \& staff\\*
\vin And his sandal shoon.'\\!

And what signs have told you now\\*
\vin That he hastens home?\\
`Lo, the spring is nearly gone;\\*
\vin He is nearly come.'\\!

For a token is there nought,\\*
\vin Say, that he should bring?\\
`He will bear a ring I gave\\*
\vin And another ring.'\\!

How may I, when he shall ask,\\*
\vin Tell him who lies there?\\
`Nay, but leave my face unveiled\\*
\vin And unbound my hair.'\\!

Can you say to me some word\\*
\vin I shall say to him?\\
`Say I'm looking in his eyes\\*
\vin Though my eyes are dim.'\\
