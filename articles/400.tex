He found her by the ocean's moaning verge,\footnotetext{George Meredith (1828 -- 1909). \cite{norton}. This is taken from \emph{Modern Love}, Meredith's sequence of poems describing the breakdown of his first marriage, to an older woman named Mary.}\\*
\vin Nor any wicked change in her discerned;\\
\vin And she believed his old love had returned,\\
Which was her exultation, \& her scourge.\\
She took his hand, and walked with him, and seemed\\
\vin The wife he sought, though shadow-like \& dry.\\
\vin She had one terror, lest her heart should sigh,\\
And tell her loudly that she no longer dreamed.\\
She dared not say, `This is my breast: look in.'\\
\vin But there's a strength to help the desperate weak.\\
\vin That night he learned how silence best can speak\\
The awful things when pity pleads for sin.\\
About the middle of the night her call\\
\vin Was heard, and he came wondering to the bed.\\
\vin `Now kiss me, dear! It may be, now!' she said.\\*
{\sc Lethe} had passed those lips, and he knew all.
