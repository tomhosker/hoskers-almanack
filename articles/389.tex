When thou must home to shades of underground,\footnotetext{Dr Thomas Campion (1567 -- 1620). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin And there arrived, a new admir\`ed guest,\\
The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,\\
\vin White \emph{Iope}, blithe \emph{Helen}, \& the rest,\\
To hear the stories of thy finished love\\*
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;\\!

Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,\\*
\vin Of masques \& revels which sweet youth did make,\\
Of tourneys \& great challenges of knights,\\
\vin And all these triumphs for thy beauty's sake:\\
When thou hast told these honours done to thee,\\*
Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me.
\end{verse}
