The silver swan, who, living, had no note,\footnotetext{`The Silver Swan', Anon. \cite{norton}. This brief poem was made into a famous madrigal by Orlando Gibbons. The identity of the author of the words is unclear, although it may have been Gibbons himself or his patron Sir Christopher Hatton.}\\*
When death approached, unlocked her silent throat.\\
Leaning her breast upon the reedy shore,\\
Thus sang her first \& last, and sang no more:\\
`Farewell, all joys! O death, come close mine eyes!\\*
More geese than swans now live, more fools than wise.'
\end{verse}
