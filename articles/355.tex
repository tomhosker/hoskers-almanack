\poemlines{5}
Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts.\footnotetext{Malachi 3-4. \cite{kjv}.}\\
But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:\\
And he shall sit as a refiner \& purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of \emph{Levi}, and purge them as gold \& silver, that they may offer unto the {\hge LORD} an offering in righteousness.\\
Then shall the offering of Judah \& {\sc Jerusalem} be pleasant unto the {\hge LORD}, as in the days of old, and as in former years.\\
And I will come near to you to judgement; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts.\\
For I am the {\hge LORD}, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.\\
Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?\\
Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes \& offerings.\\
Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.\\
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\\
And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts.\\
And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts.\\!

Your words have been stout against me, saith the {\hge LORD}. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?\\
Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the {\hge LORD} of hosts?\\
And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.\\
Then they that feared the {\hge LORD} spake often one to another: and the {\hge LORD} hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the {\hge LORD}, and that thought upon his name.\\
And they shall be mine, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.\\
Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.\\!

For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\\
But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.\\
And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the {\hge LORD} of hosts.\\!

Remember ye the law of \emph{Moses} my servant, which I commanded unto him in {\sc Horeb} for all Israel, with the statutes \&
judgments.\\
Behold, I will send you \emph{Elijah} the prophet before the coming of the great \& dreadful day of the {\hge LORD}:\\
And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
