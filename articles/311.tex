\begin{verse}
\poemlines{5}
O {\hge LORD} our governor, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!\footnotetext{Psalm 8. \cite{kjv}. The Almanackist has replaced the KJV's `our Lord' with the \emph{BCP}'s `our Governor' in the first and last verses of this psalm.}\\*
\vin Who hast set thy glory above the heavens.\\
Out of the mouth of babes \& sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies\\
\vin That thou mightest still the enemy \& the avenger.\\
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,\\
\vin The moon \& the stars, which thou hast ordained;\\
What is man, that thou art mindful of him?\\
\vin And the son of man, that thou visitest him?\\
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,\\
\vin And hast crowned him with glory \& honour.\\
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;\\
\vin Thou hast put all things under his feet:\\
All sheep \& oxen, yea,\\
\vin And the beasts of the field;\\
The fowl of the air, \& the fish of the sea,\\
\vin And whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.\\
O {\hge LORD} our governor,\\*
\vin How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
