She had no saying dark enough\footnotetext{`The Oft-Repeated Dream', Robert Frost, Poet Laureate of the United States, Poet Laureate of Vermont (1874 -- 1963). \cite{norton}. This is part of a sequence of poems called `The Hill Wife'.}\\*
\vin For the dark pine that kept\\
Forever trying the window latch\\*
\vin Of the room where they slept.\\!

The tireless but ineffectual hands\\*
\vin That with every futile pass\\
Made the great tree seem as a little bird\\*
\vin Before the mystery of glass.\\!

It never had been inside the room,\\*
\vin And only one of the two\\
Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream\\*
\vin Of what the tree might do.\\!
