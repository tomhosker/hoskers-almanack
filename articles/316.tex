O praise the Lord of heaven;\footnotetext{Psalm 148.1-13. \cite{bcp}}\\*
\vin Praise him in the height.\\
Praise him, all ye angels of his;\\
\vin Praise him, all his host.\\
Praise him, sun \& moon;\\
\vin Praise him, all ye stars \& light.\\
Praise him, all ye heavens,\\
\vin And ye waters that are above the heavens.\\
Let them praise the Name of the Lord;\\
\vin For he spake the word, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.\\
He hath made them fast for ever \& ever;\\
\vin He hath given them a law which shall not be broken.\\
Praise the Lord upon earth,\\
\vin Ye dragons, and all deeps;\\
Fire \& hail, snow \& vapours,\\
\vin Wind \& storm, fulfilling his word;\\
Mountains \& all hills,\\
\vin Fruitful trees \& all cedars;\\
Beasts \& all cattle;\\
\vin Worms \& feathered fowls;\\
Kings of the earth \& all people,\\
\vin Princes \& all judges of the world;\\
Young men \& maidens, old men \& children, praise the Name of the Lord,\\*
\vin For his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven \& earth.
