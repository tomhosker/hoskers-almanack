I dreamed that, as I wandered by the way,\footnotetext{`A Dream of the Unknown', Percy Shelley (1792 -- 1822). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
\vin Bare winter suddenly was changed to spring,\\
And gentle odours led my steps astray,\\
\vin Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring\\
Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay\\
\vin Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling\\
Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,\\*
But kissed it and then fled, as thou mightest in dream.\\!

There grew pied wind-flowers \& violets,\\*
\vin Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth,\\
The constellated flower that never sets;\\
\vin Faint oxlips; tender bluebells, at whose birth\\
The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets --\\
\vin Like a child, \sfrac{1}{2} in tenderness \& mirth --\\
Its mother's face with heaven's collected tears,\\*
When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it hears.\\!

And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,\\*
\vin Green cowbind \& the moonlight-coloured may,\\
And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose wine\\
\vin Was the bright dew, yet drained not by the day;\\
And wild roses, and ivy serpentine,\\
\vin With its dark buds \& leaves, wandering astray;\\
And flowers azure, black, \& streaked with gold,\\*
Fairer than any wakened eyes behold.\\!

And nearer to the river's trembling edge\\*
\vin There grew broad flag-flowers, purple pranked with white,\\
And starry river buds among the sedge,\\
\vin And floating water-lilies, broad \& bright,\\
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge\\
\vin With moonlight beams of their own watery light;\\
And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep green\\*
As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen.\\!

Methought that of these visionary flowers\\*
\vin I made a nosegay, bound in such a way\\
That the same hues, which in their natural bowers\\
\vin Were mingled or opposed, the like array\\
Kept these imprisoned children of the hours\\
\vin Within my hand -- and then, elate \& gay,\\
I hastened to the spot whence I had come,\\*
That I might there present it! O! to whom?
