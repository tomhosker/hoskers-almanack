Because I was happy upon the heath,\footnotetext{`The Chimney Sweeper', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}. The Almanackist has omitted the first verse.}\\*
\vin And smiled among the winter's snow,\\
They clothed me in the clothes of death,\\*
\vin And taught me to sing the notes of woe.\\!

And because I am happy \& dance \& sing,\\*
\vin They think they have done me no injury,\\
And are gone to praise God \& his Priest \& King,\\*
\vin Who make up a heaven of our misery.
\end{verse}
