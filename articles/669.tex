\poemlines{5}
\emph{Alice}, dear, what ails you,\footnotetext{`A Frosty Night', Prof Robert Graves (1895 -- 1985). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
\vin Dazed \& lost \& shaken?\\
Has the chill night numbed you?\\*
\vin Is it fright you have taken?\\!

`Mother, I am very well;\\*
\vin I was never better.\\
Mother, do not hold me so,\\*
\vin Let me write my letter.'\\!

Sweet, my dear, what ails you?\\*
\vin `No, but I am well.\\
The night was cold \& frosty --\\*
\vin There's no more to tell.'\\!

Ay, the night was frosty,\\*
\vin Coldly gaped the moon,\\
Yet the birds seemed twittering\\*
\vin Through green boughs of june.\\!

`Soft \& thick the snow lay;\\*
\vin Stars danced in the sky --\\
Not all the lambs of may-day\\*
\vin Skip so bold \& high.'\\!

Your feet were dancing, \emph{Alice},\\*
\vin Seemed to dance on air,\\
You looked a ghost or angel\\*
\vin In the star-light there.\\!

Your eyes were frosted star-light;\\*
\vin Your heart, fire \& snow.\\
Who was it said, ``I love you''?\\*
\vin `Mother, let me go!'
