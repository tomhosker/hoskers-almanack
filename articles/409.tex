When I lie where shades of darkness\footnotetext{`Fare Well', Walter de la Mare (1873 -- 1956). \cite{norton}. ``Traveller's joy'' is one of several traditional English names for the climbing shrub \emph{Clematis vitalba}.}\\*
Shall no more assail mine eyes,\\
Nor the rain make lamentation\\
\vin When the wind sighs;\\
How will fare the world whose wonder\\
Was the very proof of me?\\
Memory fades; must the remembered\\*
\vin Perishing be?\\!

O when this my dust surrenders\\*
Hand, foot, lip, to dust again,\\
May these loved \& loving faces\\
\vin Please other men.\\
May the rusting harvest hedgerow\\
Still the traveller's joy entwine,\\
And as happy children gather\\*
\vin Posies once mine.\\!

Look thy last on all things lovely,\\*
Every hour. Let no night\\
Seal thy sense in deathly slumber\\
\vin Till to delight\\
Thou have paid thy utmost blessing;\\
Since that all things thou wouldst praise\\
Beauty took from those who loved them\\*
\vin In other days.
\end{verse}
