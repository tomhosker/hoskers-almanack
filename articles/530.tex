\begin{verse}
\poemlines{5}
When science starts to be interprative\footnotetext{`Self-Protection', David Lawrence (1885 -- 1930). \cite{norton}.}\\*
It is more unscientific even than mysticism.\\!

To make self-preservation \& self-protection the first law of existence\\*
Is about as scientific as making suicide the first law of existence,\\*
And amounts to very much the same thing.\\!

A nightingale singing at the top of his voice\\*
Is neither hiding himself nor preserving himself nor propagating his species;\\
He is giving himself away in every sense of the word;\\*
And obviously, it is the culminating point of his existence.\\!

A tiger is striped \& golden for his own glory.\\*
He would certainly be much more invisible if he were grey-green.\\
And I don't suppose the ichthyosaurus sparkled like the humming-bird.\\
No doubt, he was khaki-colored with muddy protective colouration,\\*
So why didn't he survive?\\!

As a matter of fact, the only creatures that seem to survive\\*
Are those that give themselves away in flash \& sparkle\\
And gay flicker of joyful life;\\
Those that go glittering abroad\\*
With a bit of splendor.\\!

Even mice play quite beautifully at shadows,\\*
And some of them are brilliantly piebald.\\!

I expect the dodo looked like a clod,\\*
A drab \& dingy bird.
