\poemlines{5}
In our town, people live in rows.\footnotetext{`The Fired Pot', Mrs Edith Hepburn (1884 -- 1947). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. Mrs Hepburn was better known by her nom de plume Anna Wickham (and some sources state that she was born in 1883). Despite these lines, the act of \emph{turning down} a prospective sexual partner doesn't appear to be something the poetess ever practised herself.}\\* 
\vin The only irregular thing in a street is the steeple;\\
And where that points to, God only knows,\\*
\vin And not the poor disciplined people!\\!

And I have watched the women growing old,\\*
\vin Passionate about pins, \& pence, \& soap,\\
Till the heart within my wedded breast grew cold,\\*
\vin And I lost hope.\\!

But a young soldier came to our town;\\*
\vin He spoke his mind most candidly.\\
He asked me quickly to lie down,\\*
\vin And that was very good for me.\\!

For though I gave him no embrace\\*
\vin -- Remembering my duty --\\
He altered the expression of my face,\\*
\vin And gave me back my beauty.
