I dreamed this mortal part of mine\footnotetext{`The Vine', Rev Robert Herrick (1591 -- 1674). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Was metamorphosed to a vine,\\
Which crawling one \& every way\\
Enthralled my dainty \emph{Lucia}.\\
Methought her long small legs \& thighs\\
I with my tendrils did surprise;\\
Her belly, buttocks and her waist\\
By my soft nervelets were embraced.\\
About her head I writhing hung,\\
And with rich clusters (hid among\\
The leaves) her temples I behung,\\
So that my \emph{Lucia} seemed to me\\
Young \emph{Bacchus} ravished by his tree.\\
My curls about her neck did crawl,\\
And arms \& hands they did enthrall,\\
So that she could not freely stir\\
(All parts there made one prisoner).\\
But when I crept with leaves to hide\\
Those parts which maids keep unespied,\\
Such fleeting pleasures there I took\\
That with the fancy I awoke;\\
And found (ah me!) this flesh of mine\\*
More like a stock than like a vine.
