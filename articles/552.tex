\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
Your smiles are not, as other women's be,\footnotetext{$\xi$ Aurelian Townshend (?1583 -- ?1651). \cite{obev}. This poem is sometimes printed under the title `To the Lady Mary'.}\\*
\vin Only the drawing of the mouth awry;\\
For breasts \& cheeks \& forehead we may see,\\
\vin Parts wanting motion, all stand smiling by:\\
Heaven hath no mouth, and yet is said to smile\\
\vin \vin \vin After your style:\\
No more hath earth, yet that smiles too,\\*
\vin \vin \vin Just as you do.\\!

No simpering lips nor looks can breed\\*
Such smiles as from your face proceed:\\
The sun must lend his golden beams,\\
\vin Soft winds their breath, green trees their shade,\\
Sweet fields their flowers, clear springs their streams,\\
\vin Ere such another smile be made:\\
But these concurring, we may say,\\*
`So smiles the spring and so smiles lovely may.'
