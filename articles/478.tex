Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,\footnotetext{`Funeral Blues', Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,\\
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum\\*
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.\\!

Let aeroplanes circle, moaning overhead,\\*
Scribbling on the sky the message, He is dead;\\
Put cr{\^e}pe bows round the white necks of the public doves;\\*
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.\\!

He was my north, my south, my east \& west,\\*
My working week and my sunday rest,\\
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;\\*
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.\\!

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,\\*
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;\\
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;\\*
For nothing now can ever come to any good.
