\poemlines{5}
Do not err, my beloved brethren.\footnotetext{James 1.16-21. \cite{kjv}.}\\
Every good gift \& every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\\
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.\\
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:\\
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.\\
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
