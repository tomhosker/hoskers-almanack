\poemlines{5}
But now thus saith the {\hge LORD} that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.\footnotetext{Isaiah 43.1-7. \cite{kjv}.}\\
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.\\
For I am the {\hge LORD} thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.\\
Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.\\
Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;\\
I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;\\
Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.\\
