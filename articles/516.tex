Little lamb, who made thee?\footnotetext{`The Lamb', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
Dost thou know who made thee,\\
Gave thee life, and bid thee feed\\
By the stream \& o'er the mead,\\
Gave thee clothing of delight,\\
Softest clothing, woolly, bright,\\
Gave thee such a tender voice,\\
Making all the vales rejoice?\\
Little lamb, who made thee?\\*
Dost thou know who made thee?\\!

Little lamb, I'll tell thee;\\*
Little lamb, I'll tell thee:\\
He is call\`ed by thy name,\\
For he calls himself a lamb.\\
He is meek, and he is mild;\\
He became a little child.\\
I a child, and thou a lamb,\\
We are call\`ed by his name.\\
Little lamb, God bless thee.\\*
Little lamb, God bless thee.
