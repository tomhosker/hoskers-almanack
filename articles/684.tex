If honour to an ancient name be due,\footnotetext{$\xi$ `On the Welsh Language', Mrs Katherine Philips (1632 -- 1634). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Or riches challenge it for one that's new,\\
The british language claims in either sense\\
Both for its age, and for its opulence.\\
But all great things must be from us removed,\\
To be with higher reverence beloved.\\
So landscapes which in prospects distant lie,\\
With greater wonder draw the pleas\`ed eye.\\
Is not great {\sc Troy} to one dark ruin hurled?\\ 
Once the famed scene of all fighting world.\\ 
Where's {\sc Athens} now, to whom {\sc Rome} learning owes,\\
And the safe laurels that adorned her brows?\\
A strange reverse of fate she did endure,\\
Never once greater, than she's now obscure.\\
Even {\sc Rome} herself can but some footsteps show\\
Of \emph{Scipio}'s times, or those of \emph{Cicero}.\\
And as the roman \& the grecian state,\\
The british fell, the spoil of time \& fate.\\
But though the language hath the beauty lost,\\
Yet she has still some great remains to boast.\\
For 'twas in that, the sacred bards of old,\\
In deathless numbers did their thoughts unfold.\\
In groves, by rivers, and on fertile plains,\\
They civilized \& taught the listening swains;\\
Whilst with high raptures, and as great success,\\
Virtue they clothed in music's charming dress.\\
This \emph{Merlin} spoke, who in his gloomy cave,\\
Even destiny herself seemed to enslave.\\
For to his sight the future time was known,\\
Much better than to others is their own;\\
And with such state, predictions from him fell,\\
As if he did decree, and not foretell.\\
This spoke King \emph{Arthur}, who, if fame be true,\\ 
Could have compelled mankind to speak it too.\\
In this once \emph{Boadicca} valour taught,\\
And spoke more nobly than her soldiers fought:\\
Tell me what hero could be more than she,\\
Who fell at once for fame \& liberty?\\
Nor could a greater sacrifice belong,\\
Or to her children's, or her country's wrong.\\ 
This spoke \emph{Caractacus}, who was so brave,\\
That to the roman fortune check he gave:\\
And when their yoke he could decline no more,\\
He it so decently \& nobly wore,\\
That {\sc Rome} herself with blushes did believe,\\
A briton would the law of honour give;\\
And hastily his chains away she threw,\\*
Lest her own captive else should her subdue.
