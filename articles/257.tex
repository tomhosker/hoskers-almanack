Sunset \& evening star,\footnotetext{`Crossing the Bar', Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}. The `bar' in question refers to the sandbars which often lurk in the waters near to the breakwaters of ports. Lord Tennyson is said to have written this poem while on a ferry to the Isle of Wight; shortly before his death, he decreed that all editions of his works should close with these verses.}\\*
\vin And one clear call for me!\\
And may there be no moaning of the bar\\*
\vin When I put out to sea,\\!

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,\\*
\vin Too full for sound \& foam,\\
When that which drew from out the boundless deep\\* 
\vin Turns again home.\\!

Twilight \& evening bell,\\*
\vin And after that the dark!\\
And may there be no sadness of farewell,\\*
\vin When I embark;\\!

For though from out our bourne of time \& place\\*
\vin The flood may bear me far,\\
I hope to see my Pilot face to face\\*
\vin When I have crossed the bar.
