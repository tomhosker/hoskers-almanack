\emph{M\'argar\'et}, \'are you gr\'ieving\footnotetext{`Spring and Fall', Fr Gerard Hopkins (1844 -- 1889). \cite{norton}. There are several places in England and Wales known as Golden Grove (or some variation thereupon), the most famous of which is the Golden Grove estate in Camarthenshire. It's unclear, at least to the Almanackist, which Golden Grove Fr Hopkins had in mind.}\\* 
Over {\sc Goldengrove} unleaving?\\
Le\'aves like the things of man, you\\
With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?\\
Ah \'as the heart grows older\\
It will come to such sights colder\\
By \& by, nor spare a sigh\\
Though worlds of wan-wood leaf-meal lie;\\
And yet you w\'ill weep and know why.\\
Now no matter, child, the name:\\
S\'orrow's spr\'ings \'are the same.\\
Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed\\
What heart heard of, ghost guessed:\\
It \'is the blight man was born for,\\* 
It is \emph{Margaret} you mourn for.
