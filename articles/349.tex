\begin{verse}
\poemlines{5}
For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.\footnotetext{Isaiah 65.17-25. \cite{kjv}.}\\
But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create {\sc Jerusalem} a rejoicing, and her people a joy.\\
And I will rejoice in {\sc Jerusalem}, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.\\
There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an 100 years old; but the sinner being an 100 years old shall be accursed.\\
And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.\\
They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.\\
They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the {\hge LORD}, and their offspring with them.\\
And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.\\
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the {\hge LORD}.
