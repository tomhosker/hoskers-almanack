\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
Down the close, darkening lanes they sang their way\footnotetext{`The Send-off', Wilfred Owen (1893 -- 1918). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
To the siding-shed,\\
And lined the train with faces grimly gay.\\
Their breasts were stuck all white with wreath \& spray\\*
As men's are, dead.\\!

Dull porters watched them, and a casual tramp\\*
Stood staring hard,\\
Sorry to miss them from the upland camp.\\
Then, unmoved, signals nodded, and a lamp\\*
Winked to the guard.\\!

So secretly, like wrongs hushed-up, they went.\\*
They were not ours:\\*
We never heard to which front these were sent.\\!

Nor there if they yet mock what women meant\\*
Who gave them flowers.\\!

Shall they return to beatings of great bells\\*
In wild trainloads?\\
A few, a few, too few for drums \& yells,\\
May creep back, silent, to still village wells\\*
Up \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} known roads.
\end{verse}
