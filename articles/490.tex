\vin When the lamp is shattered\footnotetext{`The Flight of Love', Shelley. \cite{treasury}.}\\*
The light in the dust lies dead --\\
\vin When the cloud is scattered\\
The rainbow's glory is shed.\\
\vin When the lute is broken,\\
Sweet tones are remembered not;\\
\vin When the lips have spoken,\\*
Loved accents are soon forgot.\\!

\vin As music \& splendor\\*
Survive not the lamp \& the lute,\\
\vin The heart's echoes render\\
No song when the spirit is mute:--\\
\vin No song but sad dirges,\\
Like the wind through a ruined cell,\\
\vin Or the mournful surges\\*
That ring the dead seaman's knell.\\!

\vin When hearts have once mingled\\*
Love first leaves the well-built nest;\\
\vin The weak one is singled\\
To endure what it once possessed.\\
\vin O love! who bewailest\\
The frailty of all things here,\\
\vin Why choose you the frailest\\*
For your cradle, your home, and your bier?\\!

\vin Its passions will rock thee\\*
As the storms rock the ravens on high;\\
\vin Bright reason will mock thee,\\
Like the sun from a wintry sky.\\
\vin From thy nest every rafter\\
Will rot, and thine eagle home\\
\vin Leave thee naked to laughter,\\*
When leaves fall \& cold winds come.
