Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,\footnotetext{\cite{bcp}. The hymn is ancient, being composed by a Frankish monk, Rabanus Maurus, in the ninth century, and translated into English by the Rt Rev John Cosin, Bishop of Durham. The original hymn concludes with a further verse and a half.}\\*
And lighten with celestial fire.\\
Thou the anointing spirit art,\\*
Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart.\\!

Thy blessed unction from above\\*
Is comfort, life, and fire of love.\\
Enable with perpetual light\\*
The dullness of our blinded sight.\\!

Anoint \& cheer our soil\`ed face\\*
With the abundance of thy grace.\\
Keep far from foes, give peace at home:\\*
Where thou art guide, no ill can come.
\end{verse}
