Farewell to the bushy clump close to the river\footnotetext{`Farewell', John Clare (1793 -- 1864). \cite{norton}.}\\*
And the flags where the butter-bump hides in for ever;\\
Farewell to the weedy nook, hemmed in by waters;\\
Farewell to the miller's brook \& his three bonny daughters;\\
Farewell to them all while in prison I lie --\\*
In the prison a thrall sees nought but the sky.\\!

Shut out are the green fields and birds in the bushes;\\*
In the prison yard nothing builds, blackbirds or thrushes.\\
Farewell to the old mill \& dash of the waters,\\*
To the miller \&, dearer still, to his three bonny daughters.\\!

In the nook, the large burdock grows near the green willow;\\*
In the flood, round the moorcock dashes under the billow;\\
To the old mill farewell, to the lock, pens, \& waters,\\*
To the miller himsel', \& his three bonny daughters.
