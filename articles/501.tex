Had she come all the way for this,\footnotetext{`The Haystack in the Flood', William Morris (1834 -- 1896). \cite{norton}.}\\*
To part at last without a kiss?\\
Yea, had she borne the dirt \& rain\\
That her own eyes might see him slain\\
Beside the haystack in the floods?\\
Along the dripping leafless woods,\\
The stirrup touching either shoe,\\
She rode astride as troopers do;\\
With kirtle kilted to her knee,\\
To which the mud splashed wretchedly;\\
And the wet dripped from every tree\\
Upon her head \& heavy hair,\\
And on her eyelids broad \& fair;\\
The tears \& rain ran down her face.\\
By fits \& starts they rode apace,\\
And very often was his place\\
Far off from her; he had to ride\\
Ahead, to see what might betide\\
When the roads crossed; and sometimes, when\\
There rose a murmuring from his men,\\
Had to turn back with promises;\\
Ah me! she had but little ease;\\
And often for pure doubt \& dread\\
She sobbed, made giddy in the head\\
By the swift riding; while, for cold,\\
Her slender fingers scarce could hold\\
The wet reins; yea, and scarcely, too,\\
She felt the foot within her shoe\\
Against the stirrup : all for this,\\
To part at last without a kiss\\
Beside the haystack in the floods.\\
For when they neared that old soaked hay,\\
They saw across the only way\\
That \emph{Judas}, \emph{Godmar}, and the three.\\
Red running lions dismally\\
Grinned from his pennon, under which,\\
In one straight line along the ditch,\\*
They counted thirty heads.\\!

{\color{white} They counted thirty heads.} So then,\\*
While \emph{Robert} turned round to his men,\\
She saw at once the wretched end,\\
And, stooping down, tried hard to rend\\
Her coif the wrong way from her head,\\
And hid her eyes; while \emph{Robert} said:\\
`Nay, love, 'tis scarcely two to one,\\
At {\sc Poitiers} where we made them run\\
So fast -- why, sweet my love, good cheer,\\
The gascon frontier is so near,\\*
Nought after this.'\\!

{\color{white} Nought after this.'} But, `O,' she said,\\*
`My God! my God! I have to tread\\
The long way back without you; then\\
The court at {\sc Paris}; those six men;\\
The gratings of the {\sc Ch\^atelet};\\
The swift {\sc Seine} on some rainy day\\
Like this, and people standing by,\\
And laughing, while my weak hands try\\
To recollect how strong men swim.\\
All this, or else a life with him,\\
For which I should be damned at last,\\
Would God that this next hour were past!'\\
He answered not, but cried his cry,\\
`St \emph{George} for \emph{Marny}!' cheerily;\\
And laid his hand upon her rein.\\
Alas! no man of all his train\\
Gave back that cheery cry again;\\
And, while for rage his thumb beat fast\\
Upon his sword-hilts, some one cast\\
About his neck a kerchief long,\\*
And bound him.\\!

{\color{white} And bound him.} Then they went along\\*
To \emph{Godmar}; who said: `Now, \emph{Jehane},\\
Your lover's life is on the wane\\
So fast, that, if this very hour\\
You yield not as my paramour,\\
He will not see the rain leave off --\\
Nay, keep your tongue from gibe \& scoff,\\
Sir \emph{Robert}, or I slay you now.'\\
She laid her hand upon her brow,\\
Then gazed upon the palm, as though\\
She thought her forehead bled, and -- `No.'\\
She said, and turned her head away,\\
As there were nothing else to say,\\
And everything were settled: red \\
Grew \emph{Godmar}'s face from chin to head:\\
`\emph{Jehane}, on yonder hill there stands\\
My castle, guarding well my lands:\\
What hinders me from taking you,\\
And doing that I list to do\\
To your fair wilful body, while\\*
Your knight lies dead?'\\

{\color{white} Your knight lies dead?'} A wicked smile\\*
Wrinkled her face, her lips grew thin,\\
A long way out she thrust her chin: go\\
`You know that I should strangle you\\
While you were sleeping; or bite through\\
Your throat, by God's help -- ah!' she said,\\
`Lord \emph{Jesus}, pity your poor maid!\\
For in such wise they hem me in,\\
I cannot choose but sin \& sin,\\
Whatever happens : yet I think\\
They could not make me eat or drink,\\
And so should I just reach my rest.'\\
`Nay, if you do not my behest,\\
O \emph{Jehane}! though I love you well,'\\
Said \emph{Godmar}, 'would I fail to tell\\
All that I know.' `Foul lies,' she said.\\
`Eh? lies my \emph{Jehane}? by God's head,\\
At {\sc Paris} folks would deem them true!\\
Do you know, \emph{Jehane}, they cry for you,\\
``\emph{Jehane} the brown! \emph{Jehane} the brown!\\
Give us \emph{Jehane} to bum or drown!'' --\\ 
Eh -- gag me \emph{Robert}! -- sweet my friend,\\
This were indeed a piteous end no\\\
For those long fingers, and long feet,\\
And long neck, and smooth shoulders sweet;\\
An end that few men would forget\\
That saw it. So, an hour yet:\\
Consider, \emph{Jehane}, which to take\\*
Of life or death!'\\!

{\color{white} Of life or death!'} So, scarce awake,\\*
Dismounting, did she leave that place,\\
And totter some yards : with her face\\
Turned upward to the sky she lay,\\
Her head on a wet heap of hay,\\
And fell asleep: and while she slept,\\
And did not dream, the minutes crept\\
Round to the 12 again; but she,\\
Being waked at last, sighed quietly,\\
And strangely childlike came, and said:\\
'I will not.' Straightway \emph{Godmar}'s head,\\
As though it hung on strong wires, turned\\*
Most sharply round, and his face burned.\\!

For \emph{Robert} -- both his eyes were dry,\\*
He could not weep, but gloomily\\
He seemed to watch the rain; yea, too,\\
His lips were firm; he tried once more\\
To touch her lips; she reached out, sore\\
And vain desire so tortured them,\\
The poor grey lips, and now the hem\\*
Of his sleeve brush'd them.\\!

{\color{white} Of his sleeve brush'd them.} With a start\\*
Up \emph{Godmar} rose, thrust them apart;\\
From \emph{Robert}'s throat he loosed the bands\\
Of silk \& mail; with empty hands\\
Held out, she stood \& gazed, and saw,\\
The long bright blade without a flaw\\
Glide out from \emph{Godmar}'s sheath, his hand\\
In \emph{Robert}'s hair; she saw him bend\\
Back \emph{Robert}'s head; she saw him send\\
The thin steel down; the blow told well,\\
Right backward the knight \emph{Robert} fell,\\
And moaned as dogs do, being \sfrac{1}{2} dead,\\
Unwitting, as I deem : so then\\
\emph{Godmar} turned grinning to his men,\\
Who ran, some five or six, and beat\\*
His head to pieces at their feet.\\!

Then \emph{Godmar} turned again and said:\\*
`So, \emph{Jehane}, the first fitte is read!\\
Take note, my lady, that your way\\
Lies backward to the {\sc Ch\^atelet}!'\\
She shook her head and gazed awhile\\
At her cold hands with a rueful smile,\\*
As though this thing had made her mad.\\!

This was the parting that they had\\*
Beside the haystack in the floods.
