\poemlines{5}
At dinner, she is hostess; I am host.\footnotetext{$\zeta$ George Meredith (1828 -- 1909). \cite{norton}. This is taken from \emph{Modern Love}, Meredith's sequence of poems describing the breakdown of his first marriage, to an older woman named Mary.}\\*
\vin Went the feast ever cheerfuller? She keeps\\
\vin The topic over intellectual deeps\\
In buoyancy afloat. They see no ghost.\\
With sparkling surface-eyes we ply the ball:\\
\vin It is in truth a most contagious game:\\
\vin ``Hiding the Skeleton'' shall be its name.\\ 
Such play as this the devils might appal!\\
But here's the greater wonder; in that we,\\
\vin Enamoured of an acting nought can tire,\\
\vin Each other, like true hypocrites, admire;\\
Warm-lighted looks, love's ephemerae,\\
Shoot gaily o'er the dishes \& the wine.\\
\vin We waken envy of our happy lot.\\
\vin Fast, sweet, \& golden, shows the marriage-knot.\\*
Dear guests, you now have seen love's corpse-light shine.
