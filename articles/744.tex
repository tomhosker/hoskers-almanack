Violets from {\sc Plug Street Wood},\footnotetext{`Villanelle', Roland Leighton (1895 -- 1915). \cite{brittain}. The Almanackist heard this poem recited over Leighton's grave when he was sixteen. \P Plug Street was the name adopted by the British soldiers for Ploegsteert, a Belgian village.}\\*
Sweet, I send you from oversea.\\
(It is strange they should be blue,\\
Blue, when his soaked blood was red,\\
For they grew around his head:\\*
It is strange they should be blue.)\\!

Violets from {\sc Plug Street Wood},\\*
Think what they have meant to me --\\
Life \& hope \& love \& you.\\
(And you did not see them grow,\\
Where his mangled body lay,\\
Hiding horror from the day;\\*
Sweetest it was better so.)\\!

Violets from oversea,\\*
To your dear, far, forgetting land,\\
These I send in memory,\\*
Knowing you will understand.
