\vin \vin In a solitude of the sea\footnotetext{`The Convergence of the Twain', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{norton}. Hardy wrote this poem in response to the sinking of the RMS \emph{Titanic}. His ideas about the `immanent will' seem to owe a debt to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer.}\\*
\vin \vin Deep from human vanity,\\*
And the pride of life that planned her, stilly couches she.\\!

\vin \vin Steel chambers, late the pyres\\*
\vin \vin Of her salamandrine fires,\\*
Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.\\!

\vin \vin Over the mirrors meant\\*
\vin \vin To glass the opulent\\*
The sea-worm crawls -- grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.\\!

\vin \vin Jewels in joy designed\\*
\vin \vin To ravish the sensuous mind\\*
Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared \& black \& blind.\\!

\vin \vin Dim moon-eyed fishes near\\*
\vin \vin Gaze at the gilded gear\\*
And query: `What does this vaingloriousness down here?'\\!

\vin \vin Well: while was fashioning\\*
\vin \vin This creature of cleaving wing,\\*
The immanent will that stirs \& urges everything\\!

\vin \vin Prepared a sinister mate\\*
\vin \vin For her -- so gaily great --\\*
A shape of ice, for the time far \& dissociate.\\!

\vin \vin And as the smart ship grew\\*
\vin \vin In stature, grace, \& hue,\\*
In shadowy silent distance grew the iceberg too.\\!

\vin \vin Alien they seemed to be;\\*
\vin \vin No mortal eye could see\\*
The intimate welding of their later history,\\!

\vin \vin Or sign that they were bent\\*
\vin \vin By paths coincident\\*
On being anon twin halves of one august event,\\!

\vin \vin Till the spinner of the years\\*
\vin \vin Said `Now!' And each one hears,\\*
And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.
