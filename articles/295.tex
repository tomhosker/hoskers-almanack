Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous,\footnotetext{Psalm 33.1-11. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin For it becometh well the just to be thankful.\\
Praise the Lord with harp;\\
\vin Sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of ten strings.\\
Sing unto the Lord a new song;\\
\vin Sing praises lustily unto him with a good courage.\\
For the word of the Lord is true,\\
\vin And all his works are faithful.\\
He loveth righteousness and judgement;\\
\vin The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.\\
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made,\\
\vin And all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth.\\
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap,\\
\vin And layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.\\
Let all the earth fear the Lord;\\
\vin Stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.\\
For he spake, and it was done;\\
\vin He commanded, and it stood fast.\\
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought,\\
\vin And maketh the devices of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.\\
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever,\\
\vin And the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation.\\
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord,\\*
\vin And blessed are the folk, that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
