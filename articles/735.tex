Others -- I am not the first --\footnotetext{Prof Alfred Housman (1859 -- 1936). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
Have willed more mischief than they durst:\\
If in the breathless night I too\\*
Shiver now, 'tis nothing new.\\!

More than I, if truth were told,\\*
Have stood and sweated hot \& cold,\\
And through their reins in ice \& fire\\*
Fear contended with desire.\\!

Agued once like me were they,\\*
But I like them shall win my way\\
Lastly to the bed of mould\\*
Where there's neither heat nor cold.\\!

But from my grave across my brow\\*
Plays no wind of healing now,\\
And fire \& ice within me fight\\*
Beneath the suffocating night.
\end{verse}
