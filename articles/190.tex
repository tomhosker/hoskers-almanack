There was a roaring in the wind all night;\footnotetext{`Resolution and Independence', Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
\vin The rain came heavily and fell in floods;\\
But now the sun is rising calm \& bright;\\
\vin The birds are singing in the distant woods;\\ 
\vin Over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods;\\ 
The jay makes answer as the magpie chatters;\\*
And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.\\!

All things that love the sun are out of doors;\\*
\vin The sky rejoices in the morning's birth;\\
The grass is bright with rain-drops; on the moors\\ 
\vin The hare is running races in her mirth;\\
\vin And with her feet she from the plashy earth\\ 
Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun,\\*
Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.\\! 

I was a traveller then upon the moor;\\*
\vin I saw the hare that raced about with joy;\\ 
I heard the woods and distant waters roar;\\
\vin Or heard them not, as happy as a boy:\\
\vin The pleasant season did my heart employ:\\ 
My old remembrances went from me wholly;\\*
And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy.\\!

But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might\\*
\vin Of joys in minds that can no further go,\\
As high as we have mounted in delight\\
\vin In our dejection do we sink as low;\\
\vin To me that morning did it happen so;\\
And fears and fancies thick upon me came;\\*
Dim sadness -- and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name.\\!

I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky;\\* 
\vin And I bethought me of the playful hare:\\
Even such a happy child of earth am I;\\
\vin Even as these blissful creatures do I fare;\\
\vin Far from the world I walk, and from all care;\\
But there may come another day to me --\\*
Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.\\!

My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought,\\*
\vin As if life's business were a summer mood;\\
As if all needful things would come unsought\\
\vin To genial faith, still rich in genial good;\\
\vin But how can He expect that others should\\
Build for him, sow for him, and at his call\\* 
Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?\\!

I thought of \emph{Chatterton}, the marvellous boy,\\* 
\vin The sleepless soul that perished in his pride;\\
Of him who walked in glory and in joy\\ 
\vin Following his plough, along the mountain-side:\\ 
\vin By our own spirits are we deified:\\
We Poets in our youth begin in gladness;\\* 
But thereof come in the end despondency \& madness.\\! 

Now, whether it were by peculiar grace,\\*
\vin A leading from above, a something given,\\
Yet it befell that, in this lonely place,\\
\vin When I with these untoward thoughts had striven,\\ 
\vin Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven\\
I saw a man before me unawares:\\*
The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.\\!

As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie\\*
\vin Couched on the bald top of an eminence;\\
Wonder to all who do the same espy,\\
\vin By what means it could thither come, and whence;\\ 
\vin So that it seems a thing endued with sense:\\
Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf\\* 
Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;\\!

Such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead,\\* 
\vin Nor all asleep -- in his extreme old age:\\
His body was bent double, feet \& head\\
\vin Coming together in life's pilgrimage;\\
\vin As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage\\
Of sickness felt by him in times long past,\\*
A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.\\!

Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face,\\*
\vin Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood:\\
And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,\\ 
\vin Upon the margin of that moorish flood\\
\vin Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood,\\
That heareth not the loud winds when they call,\\*
And moveth all together, if it move at all.\\!

At length, himself unsettling, he the pond\\*
\vin Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look\\ 
Upon the muddy water, which he conned,\\
\vin As if he had been reading in a book:\\
\vin And now a stranger's privilege I took;\\
And, drawing to his side, to him did say,\\*
`This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.'\\!

A gentle answer did the old man make,\\*
\vin In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew:\\ 
And him with further words I thus bespake,\\
\vin `What occupation do you there pursue?\\ 
\vin This is a lonesome place for one like you.'\\
Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise\\*
Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes.\\!

His words came feebly, from a feeble chest,\\*
\vin But each in solemn order followed each,\\
With something of a lofty utterance drest --\\
\vin Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach\\
\vin Of ordinary men; a stately speech;\\
Such as grave livers do in Scotland use,\\*
Religious men, who give to God and man their dues.\\!

He told, that to these waters he had come\\
\vin To gather leeches, being old and poor:\\
Employment hazardous and wearisome!\\
\vin And he had many hardships to endure:\\
\vin From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;\\
Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance;\\*
And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.\\!

The old man still stood talking by my side;\\*
\vin But now his voice to me was like a stream\\
Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide;\\
\vin And the whole body of the Man did seem\\
\vin Like one whom I had met with in a dream;\\
Or like a man from some far region sent,\\*
To give me human strength, by apt admonishment.\\!

My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills;\\*
\vin And hope that is unwilling to be fed;\\
Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;\\
\vin And mighty Poets in their misery dead.\\
\vin Perplexed, and longing to be comforted,\\
My question eagerly did I renew,\\*
`How is it that you live, and what is it you do?'\\!

He with a smile did then his words repeat;\\*
\vin And said that, gathering leeches, far \& wide\\
He travelled; stirring thus about his feet\\
\vin The waters of the pools where they abide.\\
\vin `Once I could meet with them on every side;\\
But they have dwindled long by slow decay;\\*
Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may.'\\!

While he was talking thus, the lonely place,\\*
\vin The old man's shape, and speech -- all troubled me:\\ 
In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace\\
\vin About the weary moors continually,\\
\vin Wandering about alone and silently.\\
While I these thoughts within myself pursued,\\*
He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed.\\!

And soon with this he other matter blended,\\*
\vin Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,\\
But stately in the main; and, when he ended,\\
\vin I could have laughed myself to scorn to find\\
\vin In that decrepit man so firm a mind.\\
`God,' said I, `be my help and stay secure;\\*
I'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!'
