\poemlines{5}
Death, be not proud, though some have called thee\footnotetext{Rev Dr John Donne (1572 -- 1631). \cite{obev}. This is the tenth of the Very Rev Dr Donne's \emph{Holy Sonnets}.}\\*
\vin Mighty \& dreadful, for thou art not so;\\
\vin For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow\\
Die not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me.\\
From rest \& sleep, which but thy pictures be,\\
\vin Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,\\
\vin And soonest our best men with thee do go,\\
Rest of their bones, \& soul's delivery.\\
Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, \& desperate men,\\
\vin And dost with poison, war, \& sickness dwell,\\
\vin And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well\\
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?\\
\vin \vin One short sleep past, we wake eternally\\*
\vin \vin And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.
