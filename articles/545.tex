\poemlines{5}
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments,\footnotetext{$\xi$ William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{obev}.}\\*
\vin Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme;\\
But you shall shine more bright in these contents\\
\vin Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.\\
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,\\
\vin And broils root out the work of masonry,\\
Nor \emph{Mars} his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn\\
\vin The living record of your memory.\\
'Gainst death \& all-oblivious enmity\\
\vin Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,\\
Even in the eyes of all posterity\\
\vin That wear this world out to the ending doom.\\
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,\\*
You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
\end{verse}
