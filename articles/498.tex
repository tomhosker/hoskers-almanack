\poemlines{5}
\emph{Cloris}, I cannot say your eyes\footnotetext{Sir Charles Sedley, 5th Baronet (1639 -- 1701). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
Did my unwary heart surprise;\\
Nor will I swear it was your face,\\
Your shape, or any nameless grace:\\
For you are so entirely fair,\\
To love a part, injustice were;\\
No drowning man can know which drop\\
Of water his last breath did stop;\\
So when the stars in heaven appear,\\
And join to make the night look clear;\\
The light we no one's bounty call,\\
But the obliging gift of all.\\
He that does lips or hands adore,\\
Deserves them only, \& no more;\\
But I love all \& every part,\\
And nothing less can ease my heart.\\
\emph{Cupid}, that lover, weakly strikes,\\*
Who can express what 'tis he likes.
