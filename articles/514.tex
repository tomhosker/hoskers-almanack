I, with whose colours \emph{Myra} dressed her head,\footnotetext{Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, 13th Baron Latimer and 5th Baron Willoughby de Broke (1554 -- 1628). \cite{obev}. \P There was an ancient practice of divining the entrance of an unexpected guest by the patterns made by burnt material fluttering up a chimney (which Coleridge also alludes to in `Frost at Midnight'). \P Argus is a giant from Greek mythology who, having dozens of eyes, is proverbially wakeful and vigilant; however, he was lulled asleep and murdered by Mercury in order to facilitate Jupiter's illicit liaisons with Io. Vulcan, to the best of the Almanackist's knowledge, was said to have had only one full brother, Mars; the allusion here is perhaps to the trap sprung by Vulcan to catch Mars and Venus \emph{in flagrante delicto}.}\\* 
\vin I, that ware posies of her own hand-making,\\
I, that mine own name in the chimneys read\\
\vin By \emph{Myra} finely wrought ere I was waking:\\
Must I look on, in hope time coming may\\*
With change bring back my turn again to play?\\!

I, that on sunday at the church-stile found\\*
\vin A garland sweet, with true-love knots in flowers,\\
Which I to wear about mine arm was bound,\\
\vin That each of us might know that all was ours:\\
Must I now lead an idle life in wishes,\\*
And follow \emph{Cupid} for his loaves \& fishes?\\!

I, that did wear the ring her mother left,\\*
\vin I, for whose love she gloried to be blamed,\\
I, with whose eyes her eyes committed theft,\\
\vin I, who did make her blush when I was named:\\
Must I lose ring, flowers, blush, theft, and go naked,\\*
Watching with sighs till dead love be awak\`ed?\\!

I, that, when drowsy \emph{Argus} fell asleep,\\*
\vin Like jealousy o'erwatch\`ed with desire,\\
Was even warn\`ed modesty to keep,\\
\vin While her breath, speaking, kindled nature's fire:\\
Must I look on a-cold, while others warm them?\\*
Do \emph{Vulcan}'s brothers in such fine nets arm them?\\!

Was it for this that I might \emph{Myra} see\\*
\vin Washing the water with her beauties white?\\
Yet would she never write her love to me.\\
\vin Thinks wit of change, while thoughts are in delight?\\
Mad girls must safely love as they may leave;\\*
No man can print a kiss: lines may deceive.
