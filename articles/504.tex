\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
His body was as straight as \emph{Circe}'s wand;\footnotetext{$\xi$ Christopher Marlowe (1564 -- 1593). \cite{obev}.}\\*
\emph{Jove} might have sipped out nectar from his hand.\\
Even as delicious meat is to the taste,\\
So was his neck in touching, and surpassed\\
The white of \emph{Pelops}' shoulder: I could tell ye,\\
How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;\\
And whose immortal fingers did imprint\\
That heavenly path with many a curious dint\\
That runs along his back; but my rude pen\\
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,\\
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice\\
That my slack muse sings of \emph{Leander}'s eyes;\\
Those orient cheeks \& lips, exceeding his\\
That leapt into the water for a kiss\\
Of his own shadow, and, despising many,\\
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.\\
Had wild \emph{Hippolytus} \emph{Leander} seen,\\
Enamoured of his beauty had he been.\\
His presence made the rudest peasant melt,\\
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;\\
The barbarous thracian soldier, moved with nought,\\
Was moved with him, and for his favour sought.\\
Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,\\
For in his looks were all that men desire:\\
A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,\\
A brow for love to banquet royally;\\
And such as knew he was a man, would say,\\
`Leander, thou art made for amorous play;\\
Why art thou not in love, and loved of all?\\*
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.'
