Black beauty, which above that common light,\footnotetext{Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury (1582 -- 1648). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Whose power can no colours here renew\\
\vin But those which darkness can again subdue,\\
Dost still remain unvaryed to the sight;\\
\vin And, like an object equal to the view,\\
Art neither changed with day, nor hid with night;\\
When all these colours which the world call bright,\\
\vin And which old poetry doth so pursue,\\
Are with the night so perish\`ed \& gone,\\
\vin That of their being there remains no mark,\\
Thou still abidest so entirely one,\\
\vin That we may know thy blackness is a spark\\
Of light inaccessible, and alone\\*
\vin Our darkness which can make us think it dark.
\end{verse}
