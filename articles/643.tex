The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\footnotetext{`Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard', Prof Thomas Gray (1716 -- 1771). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
\vin The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,\\
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,\\*
\vin And leaves the world to darkness and to me.\\!

Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,\\*
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,\\
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\\*
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;\\!

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r\\*
The moping owl does to the moon complain\\
Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,\\*
Molest her ancient solitary reign.\\!

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,\\*
Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,\\
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,\\*
The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\\!

The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\\*
The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,\\
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\\*
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.\\!

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\\*
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:\\*
No children run to lisp their sire's return,\\*
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.\\!

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\\*
Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;\\
How jocund did they drive their team afield!\\*
How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\\!

Let not ambition mock their useful toil,\\*
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;\\
Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\\*
The short \& simple annals of the poor.\\!

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,\\*
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,\\
Awaits alike th'inevitable hour.\\*
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\\!

Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,\\*
If mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise,\\
Where thro' the long-drawn aisle \& fretted vault\\*
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\\!

Can storied urn or animated bust\\*
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\\
Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,\\*
Or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?\\!

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid\\*
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\\
Hands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,\\*
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.\\!

But knowledge to their eyes her ample page\\*
Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;\\
Chill penury repressed their noble rage,\\*
And froze the genial current of the soul.\\!

Full many a gem of purest ray serene,\\*
The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear:\\
Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,\\*
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.\\!

Some village-\emph{Hampden}, that with dauntless breast\\* 
The little tyrant of his fields withstood;\\
Some mute inglorious \emph{Milton} here may rest,\\*
Some \emph{Cromwell} guiltless of his country's blood.\\!

Th'applause of list'ning senates to command,\\*
The threats of pain \& ruin to despise,\\
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,\\*
And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes,\\!

Their lot forbade: nor circumscribed alone\\*
Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;\\
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,\\*
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\\!

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\\*
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\\
Or heap the shrine of luxury \& pride\\* 
With incense kindled at the muse's flame.\\!

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,\\*
Their sober wishes never learned to stray;\\
Along the cool sequestered vale of life\\*
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.\\!

Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,\\*
Some frail memorial still erected nigh,\\
With uncouth rhymes \& shapeless sculpture decked,\\*
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.\\!

Their name, their years, spelt by th'unlettered muse,\\*
The place of fame and elegy supply:\\
And many a holy text around she strews,\\*
That teach the rustic moralist to die.\\!

For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,\\*
This pleasing anxious being e'er resigned,\\
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\\*
Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?\\!

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,\\*
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;\\
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of nature cries,\\*
Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.\\!

For thee, who mindful of th'unhonoured dead\\*
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;\\
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,\\*
Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,\\!

Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,\\*
`Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\\
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away\\*
To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.\\!

`There at the foot of yonder nodding beech\\*
That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,\\
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,\\*
And pore upon the brook that babbles by.\\!

`Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\\*
Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,\\
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\\*
Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.\\!

`One morn I missed him on the customed hill,\\* 
Along the heath \& near his fav'rite tree;\\
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,\\*
Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\\!

`The next with dirges due in sad array\\*
Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.\\
Approach \& read (for thou canst read) the lay,\\*
Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.'\\!

\flagverse{\footnotesize The Epitaph}{\it Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,\\*
A youth to fortune \& to fame unknown.\\
Fair science frowned not on his humble birth,\\*
And melancholy marked him for her own.\\!

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\\*
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:\\
He gave to mis'ry all he had, a tear,\\*
He gained from heav'n ('twas all he wished) a friend.\\!

No farther seek his merits to disclose,\\*
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,\\
(There they alike in trembling hope repose)\\*
The bosom of his Father \& his God.}
