Just when our drawing-rooms begin to blaze\footnotetext{William Cowper (1731 -- 1800). \cite{norton}. This is an excerpt from a long poem, \emph{The Task}, a series of urbane reflections.}\\*
With lights by clear reflection multiplied\\
From many a mirror (in which he of {\sc Gath},\\
\emph{Goliath}, might have seen his giant bulk\\
Whole without stooping, tow'ring crest \& all),\\
My pleasures too begin. But me perhaps\\
The glowing hearth may satisfy awhile\\
With faint illumination that uplifts\\
The shadow to the ceiling, there by fits\\
Dancing uncouthly to the quiv'ring flame.\\
Not undelightful is an hour to me\\
So spent in parlour twilight; such a gloom\\
Suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind,\\
The mind contemplative, with some new theme\\
Pregnant, or indisposed alike to all.\\
Laugh ye, who boast your more mercurial pow'rs\\
That never feel a stupor, know no pause\\
Nor need one. I am conscious, and confess\\
Fearless, a soul that does not always think.\\
Me oft has fancy ludicrous \& wild\\
Soothed with a waking dream of houses, tow'rs,\\
Trees, churches, \& strange visages expressed\\
In the red cinders, while with poring eye\\
I gazed, myself creating what I saw.\\
Nor less amused have I quiescent watched\\
The sooty films that play upon the bars --\\
Pendulous, \& foreboding in the view\\
Of superstition, prophesying still,\\
Though still deceived, some stranger's near approach.\\
'Tis thus the understanding takes repose\\
In indolent vacuity of thought,\\
And sleeps \& is refrshed. Meanwhile the face\\
Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask\\
Of deep deliberation, as the man\\
Were tasked to his full strength, absorbed \& lost.\\
Thus oft reclined at ease, I lose an hour\\
At evening, till at length the freezing blast\\
That sweeps the bolted shutter, summons home\\
The recollected powers and, snapping short\\
The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves\\
Her brittle toys, restores me to myself.\\
How calm is my recess, and how the frost\\
Raging abroad, and the rough wind, endear\\
The silence \& the warmth enjoyed within.\\
I saw the woods \& fields at close of day,\\
A variegated show; the meadows green\\
Though faded, and the lands where lately waved\\
The golden harvest, of a mellow brown,\\
Upturned so lately by the forceful share.\\
I saw far off the weedy fallows smile\\
With verdure not unprofitable, grazed\\
By flocks fast-feeding \& selecting each\\
His fav'rite herb; while all the leafless groves\\
That skirt th'horizon wore a sable hue\\
Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.\\
Tomorrow brings a change, a total change\\
Which even now -- though silently performed\\
And slowly, and by most unfelt -- the face\\
Of universal nature undergoes.\\
Fast falls a fleecy show'r. The downy flakes\\
Descending, and with never-ceasing lapse\\
Softly alighting upon all below,\\
Assimilate all objects. Earth receives\\
Gladly the thick'ning mantle, \& the green\\
And tender blade that feared the chilling blast\\*
Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil.
