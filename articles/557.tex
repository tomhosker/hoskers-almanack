\poemlines{5}
When night stirred at sea\footnotetext{`The Planter's Daughter', Austin (1896 -- 1974). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
And the fire brought a crowd in,\\
They say that her beauty\\
Was music in mouth\\
And few in the candlelight\\
Thought her too proud,\\
For the house of the planter\\*
Is known by the trees.\\!

Men that had seen her\\*
Drank deep and were silent;\\
The women were speaking\\
Wherever she went --\\
As a bell that is rung\\
Or a wonder told shyly,\\
And O she was the sunday\\*
In every week.
\end{verse}
