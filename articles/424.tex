\vin What bright soft thing is this?\footnotetext{$\zeta \dagger$ `The Tear', Rev Richard Crashaw (1613 -- 1649). \cite{norton}.}\\*
Sweet \emph{Mary}, the fair eyes' expense?\\
\vin A moist spark it is,\\
A wat'ry diamond; from whence\\
The very term, I think, was found\\*
The water of a diamond.\\!

\vin O 'tis not a tear,\\*
'Tis a star about to drop\\
\vin From thine eye its sphere;\\
The sun will stoop \& take it up.\\
Proud will his sister be to wear\\*
This thine eyes' jewel in her ear.\\!

\vin O 'tis a tear,\\*
Too true a tear; for no sad eyne,\\
\vin How sad so e'er,\\
Rain so true a teare as thine;\\
Each drop leaving a place so dear,\\*
Weeps for itself, is its own tear.\\!

\vin Such a pearl as this is,\\*
(Slipped from \emph{Aurora}'s dewy breast)\\
\vin The rosebud's sweet lip kisses;\\
And such the rose itself, when vexed\\
With ungentle flames, does shed,\\*
Sweating in too warm a bed.\\!

\vin Such the maiden gem,\\*
By the wanton spring put on,\\
\vin Peeps from her parent stem,\\
And blushes on the manly sun:\\
This wat'ry blossom of thy eyne,\\*
Ripe, will make the richer wine.\\!

\vin Fair drop, why quak'st thou so?\\*
'Cause thou straight must lay thy head\\
\vin In the dust? O no;\\
The dust shall never be thy bed:\\
A pillow for thee will I bring,\\*
Stuffed with down of angels' wing.\\!

\vin Thus carried up on high,\\*
(For to heaven thou must go)\\ 
\vin Sweetly shalt thou lie\\
And in soft slumbers bathe thy woe;\\
Till the singing orbs awake thee,\\*
And one of their bright chorus make thee.\\!

\vin There thy self shalt be\\*
An eye, but not a weeping one,\\
\vin Yet I doubt of thee,\\
Whether th'hadst rather there have shone\\
An eye of heaven; or still shine here,\\*
In th'heaven of \emph{Mary}'s eye, a tear.
