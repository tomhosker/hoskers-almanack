\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
Going by \emph{Daly}'s shanty I heard the boys within\footnotetext{`The Emigrant', Dr John Masefield (1878 -- 1967). \cite{masefield}.}\\*
Dancing the spanish hornpipe to \emph{Driscoll}'s violin;\\
I heard the sea-boots shaking the rough planks of the floor,\\*
But I was going westward, I hadn't heart for more.\\!

All down the windy village the noise rang in my ears;\\*
Old sea-boots stamping, shuffling, it brought the bitter tears;\\
The old tune piped \& quavered; the lilts came clear and strong;\\* 
But I was going westward, I couldn't join the song.\\!

There were the grey stone houses, the night wind blowing keen,\\*
The hill-sides pale with moonlight, the young corn springing green,\\
The hearth nooks lit \& kindly, with dear friends good to see,\\*
But I was going westward, and the ship waited me.
