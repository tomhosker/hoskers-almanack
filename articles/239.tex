\poemlines{5}
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,\footnotetext{William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616) \cite{shakespeare}. These famous lines are uttered by Caliban in \emph{The Tempest} III.2.}\\*
Sounds \& sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.\\
Sometimes a 1000 twangling instruments\\
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices\\
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,\\
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,\\
The clouds methought would open and show riches\\
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,\\*
I cried to dream again.
\end{verse}
