Behold her, single in the field,\footnotetext{`The Solitary Reaper', Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850). \cite{norton}. \P The poet needs someone to interpret the song for him because the girl is singing in Gallic.}\\* 
\vin Yon solitary highland lass,\\
Reaping and singing by herself.\\ 
\vin Stop here, or gently pass!\\
Alone she cuts \& binds the grain,\\
And sings a melancholy strain;\\
O listen, for the vale profound\\*
Is overflowing with the sound.\\!

No nightingale did ever chaunt\\* 
\vin More welcome notes to weary bands\\ 
Of travellers in some shady haunt,\\
\vin Among arabian sands:\\
A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard\\
In spring-time from the cuckoo-bird,\\
Breaking the silence of the seas\\*
Among the farthest Hebrides.\\!

Will no one tell me what she sings?\\* 
\vin Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow\\
For old, unhappy, far-off things,\\
\vin And battles long ago:\\
Or is it some more humble lay,\\ 
Familiar matter of today?\\
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,\\* 
That has been, and may be again?\\!

Whate'er the theme, the maiden sang\\* 
\vin As if her song could have no ending;\\
I saw her singing at her work,\\
\vin And o'er the sickle bending;\\
I listened, motionless \& still;\\
And, as I mounted up the hill,\\
The music in my heart I bore,\\*
Long after it was heard no more.\\!
