Two or three visits, \& two or three bows,\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `Two or Three: A Recipe to Make a Cuckold', Alexander Pope (1688 -- 1744). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
Two or three civil things, two or three vows,\\
Two or three kisses, with two or three sighs,\\
Two or three ``\emph{Jesus}''es -- and ``Let me die''s --\\
Two or three squeezes, \& two or three touses,\\
With two or three \pounds1000 lost at their houses,\\*
Can never fail cuckolding two or three spouses.
