In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,\footnotetext{`On the Death of Mr Richard West', Prof John Gray (1716 -- 1771). \cite{norton}. Richard West is an obscure figure, the son of another Richard West, who was briefly Lord Chancellor of Ireland.}\\*
\vin And reddening \emph{Phoebus} lifts his golden fire;\\
The birds in vain their amorous descant join;\\
\vin Or cheerful fields resume their green attire;\\
These ears -- alas! -- for other notes repine,\\
\vin A different object do these eyes require;\\
My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;\\
\vin And in my breast the imperfect joys expire.\\
Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,\\
\vin And new-born pleasure brings to happier men;\\
The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;\\
\vin To warm their little loves the birds complain;\\
I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,\\*
\vin And weep the more because I weep in vain.
