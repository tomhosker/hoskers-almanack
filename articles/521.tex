Once a dream did weave a shade\footnotetext{`A Dream', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
O'er my angel-guarded bed\\
That an emmet lost its way\\*
Where on grass methought I lay.\\!

Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,\\*
Dark, benighted, travel-worn,\\
Over many a tangle spray,\\*
All heart-broke, I heard her say:\\!

`Oh my children! Do they cry?\\*
Do they hear their father sigh?\\
Now they look abroad to see,\\
Now return and weep for me.'\\!

Pitying, I dropped a tear:\\*
But I saw a glow-worm near\\
Who replied, `What wailing wight\\*
Calls the watchman of the night?\\!

`I am set to light the ground\\*
While the beetle goes his round:\\
Follow now the beetle's hum;\\*
Little wanderer, hie thee home.
\end{verse}
