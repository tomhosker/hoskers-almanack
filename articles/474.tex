`O where are you going?' said reader to rider.\footnotetext{`Epilogue', Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
`That valley is fatal where furnaces burn;\\
Younder's the midden whose odours will madden;\\
That gap is the grave where the tall return.'\\!

`O do you imagine,' said fearer to farer,\\*
`That dusk will delay on your path to the pass,\\
Your diligent looking discover the lacking\\*
Your footsteps feel from granite to grass?'\\!

`O what was that bird?' said horror to hearer.\\*
`Did you see that shape in the twisted trees?\\
Behind you swiftly the figure comes softly;\\*
That spot on your skin is a shocking disease.'\\!

`Out of this house,' said rider to reader;\\*
`Yours never will,' said farer to fearer;\\
`They're looking for you,' said hearer to horror\\*
As he left him there, as he left him there.
