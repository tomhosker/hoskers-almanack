As withereth the primose by the river,\footnotetext{`A Palinode', Edmund Bolton (?1575 -- ?1633). \cite{elizabethan}.}\\*
As fadeth summer's sun from gliding fountains,\\
As vanisheth the light-blown bubble ever,\\
As melteth snow upon the mossy mountains:\\
So melts, so vanisheth, so fades, so withers,\\
The rose, the shine, the bubble, and the snow,\\
Of praise, pomp, glory, joy, which short life gathers,\\
Fair praise, vain pomp, sweet glory, brittle joy.\\
The withered primrose by the mourning river,\\
The faded summer's sun from weeping fountains,\\
The light-blown bubble vanish\`ed for ever,\\
The molten snow upon the naked mountains,\\
\vin Are emblems that the treasures we up-lay\\*
\vin Soon wither, vanish, fade, and melt away.\\!

For as the snow, whose lawn did overspread\\*
Th' ambitious hills, which giant-like did threat\\
To pierce the heavens with their aspiring head,\\
Naked \& bare doth leave their craggy seat;\\
Whenas the bubble, which did empty fly,\\
The dalliance of the undiscern\`ed wind,\\
On whose calm rolling waves it did rely,\\
Hath shipwrack made, where it did dalliance find;\\
And when the sunshine which dissolved the snow,\\
Coloured the bubble with a pleasant vary,\\
And made the rathe and timely primrose grow,\\
Swarth clouds withdrawn, which longer time do tarry:\\
\vin O what is praise, pomp, glory, joy, but so\\*
\vin As shine by fountains, bubbles, flowers, or snow?
