Since I no more do see your face\footnotetext{$\xi$ `The Wife A-Lost', Rev William Barnes (1801 -- 1886). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin Up stairs or down below,\\
I'll sit me in the lonesome place\\
\vin Where flat-boughed beech do grow;\\
Below the beeches' bough, my love,\\
\vin Where you did never come,\\
An' I don't look to meet ye now\\*
\vin As I do look at home.\\!

Since you no more be at my side\\*
\vin In walks in summer het\\
I'll go alone where mist do ride,\\
\vin Through trees a-drippin' wet;\\
Below the rain-wet bough, my love,\\
\vin Where you did never come,\\
An' I don't grieve to miss ye now\\*
\vin As I do grieve at home.\\!

Since now beside my dinner-board\\*
\vin Your voice do never sound,\\
I'll eat the bit I can afford,\\
\vin A-yield upon the ground;\\
Below the darksome bough, my love,\\
\vin Where you did never dine,\\
An' I don't grieve to miss ye now\\*
\vin As I at home do pine.\\!

Since I do miss your voice an' face\\*
\vin In prayer at eventide,\\
I'll pray wi' one sad voice for grace\\
\vin To go where you do bide;\\
Above the tree an' bough, my love,\\
\vin Where you be gone afore,\\
An' be a waitin' for me now\\*
\vin To come for evermore.
