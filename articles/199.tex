Here, where the world is quiet;\footnotetext{`The Garden of Proserpine', Algernon Swinburne (1837 -- 1909). \cite{norton}. Proserpine was the consort of Pluto, lord of the underworld.}\\* 
\vin Here, where all trouble seems\\
Dead winds' \& spent waves' riot\\
\vin In doubtful dreams of dreams;\\
I watch the green field growing\\
For reaping folk \& sowing,\\
For harvest-time \& mowing,\\* 
\vin A sleepy world of streams.\\!

I am tired of tears and laughter,\\*
\vin And men that laugh and weep;\\
Of what may come hereafter\\
\vin For men that sow to reap:\\
I am weary of days \& hours,\\
Blown buds of barren flowers,\\
Desires \& dreams \& powers\\*
\vin And everything but sleep.\\!

Here life has death for neighbour,\\*
\vin And far from eye or ear\\
Wan waves \& wet winds labour,\\
\vin Weak ships and spirits steer;\\
They drive adrift, and whither\\
They wot not who make thither;\\
But no such winds blow hither,\\*
\vin And no such things grow here.\\!

No growth of moor or coppice,\\*
\vin No heather-flower or vine,\\
But bloomless buds of poppies,\\
\vin Green grapes of \emph{Proserpine},\\
Pale beds of blowing rushes\\
Where no leaf blooms or blushes\\
Save this whereout she crushes\\*
\vin For dead men deadly wine.\\!

Pale, without name or number,\\*
\vin In fruitless fields of corn,\\
They bow themselves \& slumber\\
\vin All night till light is born;\\
And like a soul belated,\\
In hell \& heaven unmated,\\
By cloud \& mist abated\\*
\vin Comes out of darkness morn.\\!

Though one were strong as seven,\\*
\vin He too with death shall dwell,\\
Nor wake with wings in heaven,\\
\vin Nor weep for pains in hell;\\
Though one were fair as roses,\\
His beauty clouds \& closes;\\
And well though love reposes,\\*
\vin In the end it is not well.\\!

Pale, beyond porch \& portal,\\*
\vin Crowned with calm leaves, she stands\\
Who gathers all things mortal\\
\vin With cold immortal hands;\\
Her languid lips are sweeter\\ 
Than love's who fears to greet her\\
To men that mix and meet her\\*
\vin From many times \& lands.\\!

She waits for each and other,\\*
\vin She waits for all men born;\\
Forgets the earth her mother,\\
\vin The life of fruits \& corn;\\
And spring \& seed \& swallow\\ 
Take wing for her and follow\\
Where summer song rings hollow\\*
\vin And flowers are put to scorn.\\!

There go the loves that wither,\\*
\vin The old loves with wearier wings;\\
And all dead years draw thither,\\
\vin And all disastrous things;\\
Dead dreams of days forsaken,\\
Blind buds that snows have shaken,\\
Wild leaves that winds have taken,\\*
\vin Red strays of ruined springs.\\!

We are not sure of sorrow,\\*
\vin And joy was never sure;\\
To-day will die to-morrow;\\ 
\vin Time stoops to no man's lure;\\ 
And love, grown faint and fretful,\\ 
With lips but half regretful\\
Sighs, and with eyes forgetful\\*
\vin Weeps that no loves endure.\\!

From too much love of living,\\*
\vin From hope and fear set free,\\
We thank with brief thanksgiving\\
\vin Whatever gods may be\\
That no life lives for ever;\\
That dead men rise up never;\\
That even the weariest river\\*
\vin Winds somewhere safe to sea.\\!

Then star nor sun shall waken,\\*
\vin Nor any change of light:\\
Nor sound of waters shaken,\\
\vin Nor any sound or sight:\\
Nor wintry leaves nor vernal,\\
Nor days nor things diurnal;\\
Only the sleep eternal\\*
\vin In an eternal night.
