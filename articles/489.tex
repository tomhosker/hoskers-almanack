Time that is intolerant\footnotetext{`In Memory of W. B. Yeats', \S 3, Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}. The Almanackist omitted the first verse. The poem was written shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.}\\*
Of the brave \& innocent,\\
And indifferent in a week\\*
To a beautiful physique,\\!

Worships language and forgives\\*
Everyone by whom it lives.;\\
Pardons cowardice, conceit,\\*
Lays its honours at their feet.\\!

Time that which this strange excuse\\*
Pardoned \emph{Kipling} \& his views,\\
And will pardon \emph{Paul Claudel},\\*
Pardons him for writing well.\\!

In the nightmare of the dark\\*
All the dogs of Europe bark,\\
And the living nations wait,\\*
Each sequestered in its hate;\\!

Intellectual disgrace\\*
Stares from every human face,\\
And the seas of pity lie\\*
Locked \& frozen in each eye.\\!

Follow, poet, follow right\\*
To the bottom of the night;\\
With your unconstraining voice\\*
Still persuade us to rejoice;\\!

With the farming of a verse\\*
Make a vineyard of the curse;\\
Sing of human unsuccess\\*
In a rapture of distress;\\!

In the deserts of the heart\\*
Let the healing fountain start;\\
In the prison of his days\\*
Teach the free man how to praise.
