\poemlines{5}
Why should I blame her that she filled my days\footnotetext{`No Second Troy', William Yeats (1865 -- 1939). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\* 
\vin With misery, or that she would of late\\
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,\\
\vin Or hurled the little streets upon the great,\\
Had they but courage equal to desire?\\
\vin What could have made her peaceful with a mind\\
That nobleness made simple as a fire,\\
\vin With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind\\
That is not natural in an age like this,\\
\vin Being high \& solitary \& most stern?\\
Why, what could she have done, being what she is?\\*
\vin Was there another {\sc Troy} for her to burn?
