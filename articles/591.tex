\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds, \& bowers,\footnotetext{`The Argument of His Book', Robert Herrick (1591 -- 1674). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
Of april, may, of june, \& july flowers.\\
I sing of may-poles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes,\\
Of bridegrooms, brides, \& of their bridal-cakes.\\
I write of youth, of love, and have access\\
By these to sing of cleanly wantonness.\\
I sing of dews, of rains, and piece by piece\\
Of balm, of oil, of spice, \& ambergris.\\
I sing of time's trans-shifting; and I write\\
How roses first came red, \& lilies white.\\
I write of groves, of twilights, and I sing\\
The court of \emph{Mab}, \& of the fairy king.\\ 
I write of hell; I sing (and ever shall)\\* 
Of heaven, and hope to have it after all.
