\settowidth{\versewidth}{Well you see, mister farmer, I've come for your wife.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
O there was an old farmer in Sussex did dwell,\footnotetext{`The Devil and the Ploughman', Anon. \cite{herringbone}.}\\*
And he had a wife who he didn't love well.\\!

Well the devil he came to the farmer at plough,\\*
Saying one of your family I've got to have now.\\!

Well you see, mister farmer, I've come for your wife.\\*
I hear she's the bane and torment of your life,\\*
So now I'll take her without more strife.\\!

O take her, O take her, with all of my heart,\\*
And I'm hoping that you \& she never will part.\\!

So the devil he hoisted her up on his hump,\\*
And off down to hell he has gone with a jump.\\!

And when they've travelled to purgatory's gate,\\*
The night it was dark and the hour it was late.\\*
Says he, `Take in an old Sussex chap's mate.'\\!

There were two little devil a-dancing in chains;\\*
She took out a stick and clattered their brains.\\!

There were two little devils a-playing at ball,\\*
Saying, `Take her back, father. She'll murder us all.'\\!

So the devil he hoisted her up on his back,\\*
Like a bunch of potatoes bound up in a sack,\\*
And back to her house she's gone with a crack.\\!

`Well I've been a tormentor for most of my life,\\*
But I never knew torment till I met your wife.'\\!

This proves that the women is better than men;\\*
They go down to hell and get sent back again.
