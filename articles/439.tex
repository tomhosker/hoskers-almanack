\poemlines{5}
We stood by a pond that winter day,\footnotetext{`Neutral Tones', Thomas Hardy (1840 -- 1928). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,\\
\vin And a few leaves lay on the starving sod;\\*
They had fallen from an ash, and were grey.\\!

Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove\\*
\vin Over tedious riddles of years ago;\\
\vin And some words played between us to \& fro\\*
On which lost the more by our love.\\!

The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing\\*
\vin Alive enough to have strength to die;\\
\vin And a grin of bitterness swept thereby\\*
Like an ominous bird a-wing...\\!

Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,\\*
\vin And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me\\
\vin Your face, and the God-cursed sun, \& a tree,\\*
And a pond edged with greyish leaves.
