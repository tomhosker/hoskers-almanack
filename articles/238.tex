\poemlines{5}
Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,\footnotetext{William Shakespeare (1564 -- 1616). \cite{norton}. These lines are uttered by Prospero in \emph{The Tempest} V.1.}\\*
And ye that on the sands with printless foot\\
Do chase the ebbing \emph{Neptune} and do fly him\\
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that\\
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\\
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime\\
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\\
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,\\
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimmed\\
The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds,\\
And 'twixt the green sea \& the azured vault\\
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\\
Have I given fire and rifted \emph{Jove}'s stout oak\\
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory\\
Have I made shake and by the spurs plucked up\\
The pine \& cedar: graves at my command\\
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth\\
By my so potent art. But this rough magic\\
I here abjure, and, when I have required\\
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,\\
To work mine end upon their senses that\\
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,\\
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,\\
And deeper than did ever plummet sound\\*
I'll drown my book.
