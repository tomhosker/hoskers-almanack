We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;\footnotetext{Percy Shelley (1792 -- 1822). \cite{norton}. \P The third and fourth verses of this poem appear in Mrs Mary Shelley's \emph{Frankenstein}, without attribution to her husband; it is unclear whether or not she was their genuine author.}\\*
\vin How restlessly they speed, \& gleam, \& quiver,\\
Streaking the darkness radiantly -- yet soon\\*
\vin Night closes round, and they are lost forever:\\!

Or like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings\\*
\vin Give various response to each varying blast,\\
To whose frail frame no second motion brings\\*
\vin One mood or modulation like the last.\\!

We rest. A dream has power to poison sleep;\\*
\vin We rise. One wandering thought pollutes the day;\\
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep;\\*
\vin Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:\\!

It is the same. For, be it joy or sorrow,\\*
\vin The path of its departure still is free:\\
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;\\*
\vin Nought may endure but mutability.
