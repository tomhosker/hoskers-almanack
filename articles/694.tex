\poemlines{5}
O yet we trust that somehow good\footnotetext{Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, Poet Laureate (1809 -- 1892). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin Will be the final end of ill,\\
\vin To pangs of nature, sins of will,\\*
Defects of doubt, and taints of blood;\\!

That nothing walks with aimless feet;\\*
\vin That not one life shall be destroyed,\\
\vin Or cast as rubbish to the void,\\*
When God hath made the pile complete;\\!

That not a worm is cloven in vain;\\*
\vin That not a moth with vain desire\\
\vin Is shrivelled in a fruitless fire,\\*
Or but subserves another's gain.\\!

Behold, we know not anything;\\*
\vin I can but trust that good shall fall\\
\vin At last -- far off -- at last, to all,\\*
And every winter change to spring.\\!

So runs my dream: but what am I?\\*
\vin An infant crying in the night:\\
\vin An infant crying for the light:\\*
And with no language but a cry.
\end{verse}
