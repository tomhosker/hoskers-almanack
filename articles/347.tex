\begin{verse}
\poemlines{5}
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto {\sc Zion}, `Thy God reigneth!'\footnotetext{Isaiah 52.7-10. \cite{kjv}.}\\
Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the {\hge LORD} shall bring again {\sc Zion}.\\
Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of {\sc Jerusalem}: for the {\hge LORD} hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed {\sc Jerusalem}.\\
The {\hge LORD} hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
