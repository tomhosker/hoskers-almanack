Your beauty, ripe \& calm \& fresh\footnotetext{$\zeta$ `The Philosopher and the Lover; to a Mistress dying', Sir William Davenant, Poet Laureate (1606 -- 1668). \cite{obev}. This poem is a dialogue, with the lover speaking first and the philosopher second.}\\*
\vin As eastern summers are,\\
Must now, forsaking time and flesh,\\*
\vin Add light to some small star.\\!

`Whilst she yet lives, were stars decayed,\\*
\vin Their light by hers relief might find;\\
But death will lead her to a shade\\*
\vin Where love is cold and beauty blind.'\\!

Lovers, whose priests all poets are,\\*
\vin Think every mistress, when she dies,\\
Is changed at least into a star:\\*
\vin And who dares doubt the poets wise?\\!

`But ask not bodies doomed to die\\*
\vin To what abode they go;\\
Since knowledge is but sorrow's spy,\\*
\vin It is not safe to know.'
\end{verse}
