Let others sing of knights \& paladins\footnotetext{Samuel Daniel (1562 -- 1619). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin In ag\`ed accents \& untimely words;\\
Paint shadows in imaginary lines\\
\vin Which well the reach of their high wits records:\\
But I must sing of thee, and those fair eyes\\
\vin Authentic shall my verse in time to come,\\
When yet th' unborn shall say, `Lo where she lies\\
\vin Whose beauty made him speak that else was dumb.'\\
These are the arks, the trophies I erect,\\
\vin That fortify thy name against old age;\\
And these thy sacred virtues must protect\\
\vin Against the dark, and time's consuming rage.\\
Though th' error of my youth they shall discover,\\*
Suffice they show I lived and was thy lover.
\end{verse}
