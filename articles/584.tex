Fair is my love, when her fair golden heares,\footnotetext{$\dagger \xi$ Edmund Spencer (1552 -- 1599). \cite{norton}. This is one of Spenser's \emph{Amoretti}.}\\* 
With the loose wind ye waving chance to mark:\\
Fair when the rose in her red cheeks appears,\\
Or in her eyes the fire of love does spark.\\
Fair when her breast like a rich-laden bark,\\
With precious merchandise she forth doth lay:\\
Fair when that cloud of pride which oft doth dark\\
Her goodly light with smiles she drives away,\\
But fairest she, when so she doth display\\
The gate with pearls \& rubies richly dight:\\ 
Through which her words so wise do make their way\\
To bear the message of her gentle sprite.\\
The rest be works of nature's wonderment,\\*
But this the work of heart's astonishment.
\end{verse}
