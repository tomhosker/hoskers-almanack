I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea \& the sky,\footnotetext{`Sea-Fever', John Masefield, Poet Laureate (1878 -- 1967). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
And all I ask is a tall ship \& a star to steer her by;\\
And the wheel's kick \& the wind's song \& the white sail's shaking,\\*
And a grey mist on the sea's face, \& a grey dawn breaking.\\!

I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide\\*
Is a wild call \& a clear call that may not be denied;\\
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,\\*
And the flung spray \& the blown spume, \& the sea-gulls crying.\\!

I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,\\*
To the gull's way \& the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted knife;\\
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,\\*
And quiet sleep \& a sweet dream when the long trick's over.
\end{verse}
