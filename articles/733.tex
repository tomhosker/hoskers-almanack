None ever was in love with me but grief.\footnotetext{`My True Love Hath My Heart and I Have His', Miss Mary Coleridge (1861 -- 1907). \cite{newlove}. The title is a quotation from Sir Philip Sidney's \emph{Arcadia}. Miss Coleridge was a distant relation of the more famous poet with the same surname.}\\*
\vin She wooed my from the day that I was born;\\
She stole my playthings first, the jealous thief,\\*
\vin \vin And left me there forlorn.\\!

The birds that in my garden would have sung,\\*
\vin She scared away with her unending moan;\\
She slew my lovers too when I was young,\\*
\vin \vin And left me there alone.\\!

Grief, I have cursed thee often -- now at last\\*
\vin To hate thy name I am no longer free;\\
Caught in thy bony arms \& prisoned fast,\\*
\vin \vin I love no love but thee.
