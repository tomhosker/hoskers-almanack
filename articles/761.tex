\poemlines{5}
Have you heard of the blind harper,\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{rusby_underneath}.}\\*
\vin How he lived in {\sc Lochmaven} town,\\
How he went down to fair England,\\*
\vin To steal King \emph{Henry}'s wanton brown?\\!

First he went unto his wife,\\*
\vin With all the haste that go could he.\\
`This work,' he said, `it will never go well,\\*
\vin Without the help of our good grey mare.'\\!

Says she, `You take the good grey mare,\\*
\vin She'll run o'er hills both low \& high.\\
Go take the halter in your hose,\\*
\vin And leave the foal at home with me.'\\!

So he's up and went to England gone.\\*
\vin He went as fast as go could he.\\
And when he got to {\sc Carlisle} gates\\*
\vin Who should be there but King \emph{Henry}?\\!

`Come in, come in, you blind harper,\\*
\vin And of your music let me hear.'\\
But up and says the blind harper,\\*
\vin `I'd rather have a stable for my mare.'\\!

The king he looks over his left shoulder\\*
\vin And he says unto his stable groom,\\
`Go take the poor blind harper's mare,\\*
\vin And put her beside my wanton brown.'\\!

Then he's harped and then he sang,\\*
\vin Till he played them all so sound asleep,\\
And quietly he took off his shoes,\\*
\vin And down the stairs he did creep.\\!

Straight to the stable door he goes,\\*
\vin With a tread so light as light could be,\\
And when he opened and went in\\*
\vin There he found 30 steeds \& three.\\!

And he took the halter from his horse\\*
\vin And from his purse he did not fail.\\
He slipped it over the wanton's nose\\*
\vin And he's tied it to the grey mare's tail.\\!

Then he let her loose at the castle gates\\*
\vin And the mare didn't fail to find her way.\\
She's went back to her own colt foal,\\*
\vin Three long hours before the day.\\!

So then in the morning, at fair daylight\\*
\vin When they had ended all their cheer,\\
Behold the wanton brown has gone,\\*
\vin And so has the poor blind harper's mare.\\!

`And oh and alas,' says the blind harper,\\*
\vin `However alas that I came here!\\
In Scotland I've got me a little colt foal;\\*
\vin In England they stole my good grey mare.'\\!

`Hold your tongue,' says King \emph{Henry},\\*
\vin `And all your mournings let them be,\\
For you shall get a far better mare\\*
\vin And well paid shall your colt foal be.'\\!

Again he harped and again he sang;\\*
\vin The sweetest music he let them hear.\\
And he was paid for a foal that he never had lost\\*
\vin And three times over for the good grey mare.
