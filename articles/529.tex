\poemlines{5}
\vin What have we done? What cruel passion moved thee\footnotetext{`Dialogue: After Enjoyment', Abraham Cowley (1618 -- 1667) \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin \vin Thus to ruin her that loved thee?\\
\vin Me thou'st robbed, but what art thou\\
\vin Thyself the richer now?\\
\vin \vin Shame succeeds the short-lived pleasure;\\*
So soon is spent \& gone, this thy ill-gotten treasure.\\!

\vin We've done no harm; nor was it theft in me,\\*
\vin \vin But noblest charity in thee.\\
\vin I'll the well-gotten pleasure\\
\vin Safe in my mem'ry treasure;\\
\vin \vin What though the flower itself do waste,\\*
The essence from it drawn does long \& sweeter last.\\!

\vin No: I'm undone; my honour thou hast slain,\\*
\vin \vin And nothing can restore't again.\\
\vin Art \& labour to bestow\\
\vin Upon the carcass of it now\\
\vin \vin Is but t'embalm a body dead;\\*
The figure may remain; the life \& beauty's fled.\\!

\vin Never, my dear, was honour yet undone\\*
\vin \vin By love, but indiscretion.\\
\vin To th'wise it all things does allow;\\
\vin And cares not what we do, but how.\\
\vin \vin Like tapers shut in ancient urns,\\*
Unless it let in air for ever shines \& burns.\\!

\vin Thou first perhaps, who didst the fault commit,\\*
\vin \vin Wilt make thy wicked boast of it.\\
\vin For men, with roman pride, above\\
\vin The conquest, do the triumph love:\\
\vin \vin Nor think a perfect vict'ry gained\\*
Unless they through the streets their captive lead enchained.\\!

\vin Whoe'er his secret joys has open laid,\\*
\vin \vin The bawd to his own wife is made.\\
\vin Beside what boast is left for me,\\
\vin Whose whole wealth's a gift from thee?\\
\vin \vin 'Tis you the conqu'ror are; 'tis you\\*
Who have not only ta'en, but bound \& gagged me too.\\!

\vin Though publique pun'shment we escape, the sin\\*
\vin \vin Will rack \& torture us within:\\
\vin Guilt \& sin our bosom bears;\\
\vin And though fair, yet the fruit appears,\\
\vin \vin That worm which now the core does waste,\\*
When long t'as gnawed within will break the skin at last.\\!

\vin That thirsty drink, that hungry food I sought,\\*
\vin \vin That wounded balm, is all my fault.\\
\vin And thou in pity didst apply,\\
\vin The kind \& only remedy:\\
\vin \vin The cause absolves the crime; since me\\*
So mighty force did move, so mighty goodness thee.\\!

\vin Curse on thine arts. Methinks I hate thee now;\\*
\vin \vin And yet I'm sure I love thee too!\\
\vin I'm angry, but my wrath will prove,\\
\vin More innocent than did thy love.\\
\vin \vin Thou hast this day undone me quite;\\*
Yet wilt undo me more should'st thou not come at night.
