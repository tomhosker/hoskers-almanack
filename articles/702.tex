They flee from me that sometime did me seek\footnotetext{Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503 -- 1542). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
\vin With naked foot stalking in my chamber.\\
I have seen them gentle, tame and meek\\
\vin That now are wild and do not remember.\\
\vin That sometime they put themselves in danger\\
To take bread at my hand; and now they range\\*
Busily seeking with a continual change.\\!

Thanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise\\*
\vin Twenty times better, but once in special\\
In thin array after a pleasant guise\\
\vin When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,\\
\vin And me she caught in her arms long \& small;\\
Therewithal sweetly did me kiss,\\*
And softly said, `Dear heart, how like you this?'\\!

It was no dream: I lay broad waking.\\*
\vin But all is turned thorough my gentleness\\
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;\\
\vin And I have leave to go of her goodness\\
\vin And she also to use newfangleness.\\
But since that I so kindly am served,\\*
I would fain know what she hath deserved.
