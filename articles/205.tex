God moves in a mysterious way\footnotetext{`Light Shining out of Darkness', William Cowper (1731 -- 1800). \cite{norton}. Cowper rhymes with \emph{super}.}\\*
\vin His wonders to perform;\\
He plants his footsteps in the sea\\*
\vin And rides upon the storm.\\!

Deep in unfathomable mines\\*
\vin Of never-failing skill,\\
He treasures up his bright designs\\*
\vin And works his sovereign will.\\!

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;\\*
\vin The clouds ye so much dread\\
Are big with mercy and shall break\\*
\vin In blessings on your head.\\!

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,\\*
\vin But trust him for his grace;\\
Behind a frowning providence\\*
\vin He hides a smiling face.\\!

His purposes will ripen fast,\\*
\vin Unfolding every hour;\\
The bud may have a bitter taste,\\*
\vin But sweet will be the flower.\\!

Blind unbelief is sure to err\\*
\vin And scan his work in vain;\\
God is his own interpreter,\\*
\vin And he will make it plain.
