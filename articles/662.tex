Up to the bed by the window, where I be lyin',\footnotetext{$\xi$ `Old Shepherd's Prayer', Miss Charlotte Mew (1869 -- 1928). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. \P There is a Withybush in Haverfordwest (or Hwlffordd) in Pembrokeshire, and perhaps Church-Town could be St David's? But this is pure speculation. There is nothing especially Welsh -- other than the profession of sheep-farming itself -- about the shepherd and his dialect, and the place-names are probably just invented.}\\* 
\vin Comes bells \& bleat of the flock wi' they two children's clack.\\
Over, from under the eaves there's the starlings flyin',\\*
\vin And down in yard, fit to burst his chain, yapping out at \emph{Sue} I do hear young \emph{Mac}.\\!

Turning around like a falled-over sack\\*
\vin I can see team ploughin' in {\sc Whithy-bush} field \& meal carts startin' up road to {\sc Church-Town};\\
Saturday afternoon the men goin' back\\*
\vin And the women from market, trapin' home over the down.\\!

Heavenly Master, I would like to wake to they same green places\\*
\vin Where I be knowed for breakin' dogs \& follerin' sheep.\\
And if I may not walk in th'old ways and look on th'old faces\\*
\vin I would sooner sleep.
