\poemlines{5}
Lonely, save for a few faint stars, the sky\footnotetext{`The Little Dancers', Prof Laurence Binyon (1869 -- 1943). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
Dreams; and lonely, below, the little street\\
Into its gloom retires, secluded and shy.\\
Scarcely the dumb roar enters this soft retreat;\\
And all is dark, save where come flooding rays\\
From a tavern--window; there, to the brisk measure\\
Of an organ that down in an alley merrily plays,\\
Two children, all alone and no one by,\\
Holding their tattered frocks, through an airy maze\\
Of motion lightly threaded with nimble feet\\
Dance sedately; face to face they gaze,\\*
Their eyes shining, grave with a perfect pleasure.
