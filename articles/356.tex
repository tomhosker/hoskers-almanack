Thus saith the {\hge LORD}: the heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?\footnotetext{Isaiah 66.1-2. \cite{kjv}.}\\
For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the {\hge LORD}: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
