Having interred her infant-birth\footnotetext{$\xi$ `An Ode upon a Question Moved, Whether Love Should Continue for Ever?' Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury (1582 -- 1648). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin The wat'ry ground that late did mourn,\\
\vin Was strewed with flow'rs for the return\\*
Of the wished bridegroom of the earth.\\!

The well-accorded birds did sing\\*
\vin Their hymns unto the pleasant time,\\
\vin And in a sweet consorted chime\\*
Did welcome in the cheerful spring.\\!

To which, soft whistles of the wind,\\*
\vin And warbling murmurs of a brook,\\
\vin And varied notes of leaves that shook,\\*
An harmony of parts did bind.\\!

While doubling joy unto each other,\\*
\vin All in so rare concent was shown,\\
\vin No happiness that came alone,\\*
Nor pleasure that was not another.\\!

When with a love none can express,\\*
\vin That mutually happy pair,\\
\vin \emph{Melander} and \emph{Celinda} fair,\\*
The season with their loves did bless.\\!

Walking thus towards a pleasant grove,\\*
\vin What did, it seemed, in new delight\\
\vin The pleasures of the time unite,\\*
To give a triumph to their love,\\!

They stayed at last, and on the grass\\*
\vin Reposed so, as o'er his breast\\
\vin She bowed her gracious head to rest,\\*
Such a weight as no burden was.\\!

While over either's compassed waist\\*
\vin Their folded arms were so composed,\\
\vin As if in straitest bonds enclosed,\\*
They suffered for joys they did taste.\\!

Long their fixed eyes to heaven bent,\\*
\vin Unchang\`ed, they did never move,\\
\vin As if so great \& pure a love\\*
No glass but it could represent.\\!

When with a sweet, though troubled look,\\*
\vin She first brake silence, saying, `Dear friend,\\
\vin O that our love might take no end,\\*
Or never had beginning took!\\!

`I speak not this with a false heart,'\\*
\vin Wherewith his hand she gently strained,\\
\vin `Or that would change a love maintained\\*
With so much faith on either part.\\!

`Nay, I protest, though death with his\\*
\vin Worst counsel should divide us here,\\
\vin His terrors could not make me fear,\\*
To come where your loved presence is.\\!

`Only if love's fire with the breath\\*
\vin Of life be kindl\`ed, I doubt,\\
\vin With our last air 'twill be breathed out,\\*
And quench\`ed with the cold of death.\\!

That if affection be a line,\\*
\vin Which is closed up in our last hour;\\
\vin O how 'twould grieve me, any pow'r\\*
Could force so dear a love as mine!'\\!

She scarce had done, when his shut eyes\\*
\vin An inward joy did represent,\\
\vin To hear \emph{Celinda} thus intent\\*
To a love he so much did prize.\\!

Then with a look, it seemed, denied\\*
\vin All earthly pow'r but hers, yet so,\\
\vin As if to her breath he did owe\\*
This borrowed life, he thus replied;\\!

`O you, wherein, they say, souls rest,\\*
\vin Till they descend pure heavenly fires,\\
\vin Shall lustful \& corrupt desires\\*
With your immortal seed be blest?\\!

`And shall our love, so far beyond\\*
\vin That low \& dying appetite,\\
\vin And which so chaste desires unite,\\*
Not hold in an eternal bond?\\!

`Is it, because we should decline,\\*
\vin And wholly from our thoughts exclude\\
\vin Objects that may the sense delude,\\*
And study only the Divine?\\!

`No sure, for if none can ascend\\*
\vin Ev'n to the visible degree\\
\vin Of things created, how should we\\*
The invisible comprehend?\\! 

`Or rather since that Pow'r expressed\\*
\vin His greatness in his works alone,\\
\vin B'ing here best in his creatures known,\\*
Why is he not loved in them best?\\!

`But is't not true, which you pretend,\\*
\vin That since our love \& knowledge here,\\
\vin Only as parts of life appear,\\*
So they with it should take their end.\\!

`O no, beloved, I am most sure,\\*
\vin Those virtuous habits we acquire,\\
\vin As being with the soul entire,\\*
Must with it evermore endure.\\!

`For if where sins \& vice reside,\\*
\vin We find so foul a guilt remain,\\
\vin As never dying in his stain,\\*
Still punished in the soul doth bide.\\!

`Much more that true \& real joy,\\*
\vin Which in a virtuous love is found,\\
\vin Must be more solid in its ground\\*
Than fate or death can e'er destroy.\\!

`Else should our souls in vain elect,\\*
\vin And vainer yet were heaven's laws,\\
\vin When to an everlasting Cause\\*
They gave a perishing effect.\\!

`Nor here on earth then, nor above,\\*
\vin Our good affection can impair,\\
\vin For where God doth admit the fair,\\*
Think you that he excludeth love?\\!

`These eyes again, then, eyes shall see,\\*
\vin And hands again these hands enfold,\\
\vin And all chaste pleasures can be told\\*
Shall with us everlasting be.\\!

`For if no use of sense remain\\*
\vin When bodies once this life forsake,\\
\vin Or they could no delight partake,\\*
Why should they ever rise again?\\!

`And if every imperfect mind\\*
\vin Make love the end of knowledge here,\\
\vin How perfect will our love be, where\\*
All imperfection is refined?\\! 

`Let then no doubt, \emph{Celinda}, touch,\\*
\vin Much less your fairest mind invade,\\
\vin Were not our souls immortal made,\\*
Our equal loves can make them such.\\!

`So when one wing can make no way,\\*
\vin Two join\`ed can themselves dilate,\\
\vin So can two persons propagate,\\*
When singly either would decay.\\!

`So when from hence we shall be gone,\\*
\vin And be no more, nor you, nor I,\\
\vin As one another's mystery,\\*
Each shall be both, yet both but one.'\\!

This said, in her uplifted face,\\*
\vin Her eyes which did that beauty crown,\\
\vin Were like two stars, that having fall'n down,\\*
Look up again to find their place:\\!

While such a moveless silent peace\\*
\vin Did seize on their becalm\`ed sense,\\
\vin One would have thought some influence\\*
Their ravished spirits did possess.
