\poemlines{5}
The rain set early in tonight;\footnotetext{Robert Browning (1812 -- 1889). \cite{norton}. Porphyria is a blood disorder commonly thought to induce madness, although this complication is actually very rare, even when one takes into account the rarity of the disease itself.}\\*
\vin The sullen wind was soon awake;\\
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,\\
\vin And did its worst to vex the lake:\\
\vin I listened with heart fit to break.\\
When glided in \emph{Porphyria}; straight\\
\vin She shut the cold out \& the storm,\\
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate\\
\vin Blaze up, \& all the cottage warm;\\
\vin Which done, she rose, and from her form\\
Withdrew the dripping cloak \& shawl,\\
\vin And laid her soiled gloves by, untied\\
Her hat \& let the damp hair fall,\\
\vin And, last, she sat down by my side\\
\vin And called me. When no voice replied,\\
She put my arm about her waist,\\
\vin And made her smooth white shoulder bare,\\
And all her yellow hair displaced,\\
\vin And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,\\
\vin And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,\\
Murmuring how she loved me -- she\\
\vin Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,\\
To set its struggling passion free\\
\vin From pride, \& vainer ties dissever,\\
\vin And give herself to me for ever.\\
But passion sometimes would prevail,\\
\vin Nor could tonight's gay feast restrain\\
A sudden thought of one so pale\\
\vin For love of her, and all in vain:\\
\vin So, she was come through wind \& rain.\\
Be sure I looked up at her eyes\\
\vin Happy \& proud; at last I knew\\
\emph{Porphyria} worshipped me; surprise\\
\vin Made my heart swell, and still it grew\\
\vin While I debated what to do.\\
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,\\
\vin Perfectly pure \& good: I found\\
A thing to do, and all her hair\\
\vin In one long yellow string I wound\\
\vin Three times her little throat around,\\
And strangled her. No pain felt she;\\
\vin I am quite sure she felt no pain.\\
As a shut bud that holds a bee,\\
\vin I warily oped her lids: again\\
\vin Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.\\
And I untightened next the tress\\
\vin About her neck; her cheek once more\\
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:\\
\vin I propped her head up as before,\\
\vin Only, this time my shoulder bore\\
Her head, which droops upon it still:\\
\vin The smiling rosy little head,\\
So glad it has its utmost will,\\
\vin That all it scorned at once is fled,\\
\vin And I, its love, am gained instead!\\
\emph{Porphyria}'s love: she guessed not how\\
\vin Her darling one wish would be heard.\\
And thus we sit together now,\\
\vin And all night long we have not stirred,\\*
\vin And yet God has not said a word!
