Seventeen years ago you said\footnotetext{$\xi$ `A Quoi Bon Dire', Miss Charlotte Mew (1869 -- 1928). \cite{oxfordlarkin}. The French title appears to be somewhat untranslatable -- the Almanackist only speaks a very broken form of French -- but means something like, ``What good is there to say?'' or, ``What's the point of saying?'' Mew's title, however, is without a question mark; it's unclear whether this is deliberate or an oversight.}\\* 
\vin \vin Something that sounded like good-by:\\
\vin \vin And everybody thinks you are dead\\*
\vin \vin \vin \vin But I.\\!

\vin \vin So I as I grow stiff \& cold\\*
\vin To this \& that say good-by too;\\
\vin \vin And everybody sees that I am old\\*
\vin \vin \vin \vin But you.\\!

\vin \vin And one fine morning in a sunny lane\\*
\vin Some boy \& girl will meet \& kiss \& swear\\
\vin \vin That nobody can love their way again\\
\vin \vin \vin \vin While over there\\*
\vin You will have smiled; I shall have tossed your hair.
