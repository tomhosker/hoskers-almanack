As virtuous men pass mildly away,\footnotetext{`A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning', Rev Dr John Donne (1572 -- 1631). \cite{obev}.}\\*
\vin And whisper to their souls to go,\\
Whilst some of their sad friends do say\\*
\vin The breath goes now, and some say, `No:'\\!

So let us melt, and make no noise,\\*
\vin No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;\\
'Twere profanation of our joys\\*
\vin To tell the laity our love.\\!

Moving of th'earth brings harms \& fears,\\*
\vin Men reckon what it did, and meant;\\
But trepidation of the spheres,\\*
\vin Though greater far, is innocent.\\!

Dull sublunary lovers' love\\*
\vin (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit\\
Absence, because it doth remove\\*
\vin Those things which elemented it.\\!

But we by a love so much refined,\\*
\vin That our selves know not what it is,\\
Inter-assur\`ed of the mind,\\*
\vin Care less, eyes, lips, \& hands to miss.\\!

Our two souls therefore, which are one,\\*
\vin Though I must go, endure not yet\\
A breach, but an expansion,\\*
\vin Like gold to airy thinness beat.\\!

If they be two, they are two so\\*
\vin As stiff twin compasses are two;\\
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show\\*
\vin To move, but doth, if the other do.\\!

And though it in the center sit,\\*
\vin Yet when the other far doth roam,\\
It leans \& hearkens after it,\\*
\vin And grows erect, as that comes home.\\!

Such wilt thou be to me, who must,\\*
\vin Like th'other foot, obliquely run;\\
Thy firmness makes my circle just,\\*
\vin And makes me end where I begun.
