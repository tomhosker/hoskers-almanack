On a mid-december day,\footnotetext{`Since', Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
Frying sausages\\
For myself, I abruptly\\
Felt under fingers\\
Thirty years younger the rim\\
Of a steering-wheel,\\
On my cheek the parching wind\\
Of an a\'ugust noon,\\
As passenger beside me\\*
You as then you were.\\!

Slap across a veg'-growing\\*
Alluvial plain\\
We raced in clouds of white dust,\\
And geese fled screaming\\
As we missed them by inches,\\
Making a bee-line\\
For mountains gradually\\
Enlarging eastward,\\
Joyfully certain nightfall\\*
Would occasion joy.\\!

It did. In a flagged kitchen\\*
We were served broiled trout\\
And a rank cheese: for a while\\
We talked by the fire,\\
Then, carrying candles, climbed\\
Steep stairs. Love was made\\
Then \& there: so halcyoned,\\
Soon we fell asleep\\
To the sound of a river\\*
Swabbling through a gorge.\\!

Since then, other enchantments\\*
Have blazed \& faded,\\
Enemies changed their address,\\
And war made ugly\\
An uncountable number\\
Of unknown neighbours,\\
Precious as us to themselves:\\
But round your image\\
There is no fog, and the earth\\*
Can still astonish.\\!

Of what, then, should I complain,\\
Pottering about\\
A neat suburban kitchen?\\
Solitude? Rubbish!\\
It's social enough with real\\
Faces \& landscapes\\
For whose friendly countenance\\
I at least can learn\\
To live with obesity\\*
And a little fame.
