They are not long, the weeping \& the laughter,\footnotetext{`Vita summa brevis spem nos vetat incohare longam', Ernest Dowson (1867 -- 1900). \cite{norton}. The title is a quotation from Horace, \emph{Odes} 1.4 -- ``The shortness of life forbids us any long-term hopes'' -- the truth of which Dowson, with his short, occasionally brilliant, mostly miserable life, knew all too well.}\\*
\vin Love \& desire \& hate:\\
I think they have no portion in us after\\*
\vin We pass the gate.\\!

They are not long, the days of wine \& roses:\\*
\vin Out of a misty dream\\
Our path emerges for a while, then closes\\*
\vin Within a dream.\\!
