Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid: cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy holy name. Amen.\footnotetext{`For Purity', Anon. \cite{bcp}. This prayer was translated from the original Latin by the Most Rev Cranmer. \P The original prayer concludes: `through Christ our Lord. Amen.'}
