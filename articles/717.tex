As a white candle\footnotetext{`The Old Woman', Joseph Campbell (1879 -- 1944). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
\vin In a holy place,\\
So is the beauty\\*
\vin Of an aged face.\\!

As the spent radiance\\*
\vin Of the winter sun,\\
So is a woman\\*
\vin With her travail done,\\!

Her brood gone from her,\\*
\vin And her thoughts as still\\
As the waters\\*
\vin Under a ruined mill.
