Surprised by joy -- impatient as the wind\footnotetext{Dr William Wordsworth, Poet Laureate (1770 -- 1850). \cite{norton}.}\\*
\vin I turned to share the transport -- O with whom\\
\vin But thee, long buried in the silent tomb,\\
That spot which no vicissitude can find?\\
Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind --\\
\vin But how could I forget thee? Through what power,\\
\vin Even for the least division of an hour,\\
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind\\
To my most grievous loss! That thought's return\\
\vin Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,\\
Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,\\
\vin Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more;\\
That neither present time, nor years unborn\\*
\vin Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.
