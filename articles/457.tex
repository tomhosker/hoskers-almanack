\poemlines{5}
Call for the robin-redbreast \& the wren,\footnotetext{`A Land Dirge', John Webster (1580 -- 1634). \cite{treasury}.}\\*
Since o'er shady groves they hover\\
And with leaves \& flowers do cover\\
The friendless bodies of unburied men.\\
Call unto his funeral dole\\
The ant, the field-mouse, \& the mole\\
To rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm\\
And (when gay tombs are robbed) sustain no harm:\\
But keep the wolf far thence, that's foe to men,\\*
For with his nails he'll dig them up again.
\end{verse}
