\poemlines{5}
I gently touched her hand: she gave\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{newlove}.}\\*
A look that did my soul enslave;\\
I press\`ed to her rebel lips in vain:\\
They rose up to be pressed again.\\
\vin Thus happy, I no further meant\\*
\vin Than to be pleased \& innocent.\\!

On her soft breasts my hand I laid,\\*
And a quick light impression made;\\
They with a kindly warmth did glow,\\
And swelled, \& seemed to overflow.\\
\vin Yet -- trust me -- I no farther meant\\*
\vin Than to be pleased \& innocent.\\!

On her eyes my eyes did stay:\\*
On her smooth limbs my hands did stray;\\
Each sense was ravished with delight,\\
And my soul stood prepared for flight.\\
\vin Blame me not if at last I meant\\*
\vin More to be pleased than innocent.
\end{verse}
