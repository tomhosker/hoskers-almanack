\poemlines{5}
God is our refuge \& strength,\footnotetext{Psalm 46. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin A very present help in trouble.\\
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed,\\
\vin And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;\\
Though the waters thereof roar \& be troubled,\\*
\vin Though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. {\hge Selah}.\\!

There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God,\\*
\vin The holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.\\
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved:\\
\vin God shall help her, and that right early.\\
The heathen raged; the kingdoms were moved;\\
\vin He uttered his voice; the earth melted.\\
The Lord of hosts is with us;\\*
\vin The God of Jacob is our refuge. {\hge Selah}.\\!

Come, behold the works of the Lord,\\*
\vin What desolations he hath made in the earth.\\
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth;\\
\vin He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.\\
Be still, and know that I am God:\\
\vin I will be exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted in the earth.\\
The Lord of hosts is with us;\\*
\vin The God of Jacob is our refuge. {\hge Selah}.
