\poemlines{5}
One word is too often profaned\footnotetext{`To ---', Percy Shelley (1792 -- 1822). \cite{newlove}. Shelley, ever the prophet of the new secular post-Christian morality, wrote this poem to his best friend's wife.}\\*
\vin For me to profane it,\\
One feeling too falsely disdained\\
\vin For thee to disdain it.\\
One hope is too like despair\\
\vin For prudence to smother,\\
And pity from thee more dear\\*
\vin Than that from another.\\!

I can give not what men call love;\\*
\vin But wilt thou accept not\\
The worship the heart lifts above\\
\vin And the heavens reject not:\\
The desire of the moth for the star,\\
\vin Of the night for the morrow,\\
The devotion to something afar\\*
\vin From the sphere of our sorrow?
\end{verse}
