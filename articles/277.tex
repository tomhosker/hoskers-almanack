Lord, how are they increased that trouble me;\footnotetext{Psalm 3. \cite{bcp}.}\\*
\vin Many are they that rise against me.\\
Many one there is to say of my soul,\\
\vin There is no help for him in his God.\\
But thou, O Lord art my defender;\\
\vin Thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my head.\\
I did call upon the Lord with my voice,\\
\vin And he heard me out of his holy hill.\\
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again,\\
\vin For the Lord sustained me.\\
I will not be afraid for 10 thousands of the people\\
\vin That have set themselves against me round about.\\
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God, for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the cheekbone;\\
\vin Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.\\
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord,\\*
\vin And thy blessing is upon thy people.
