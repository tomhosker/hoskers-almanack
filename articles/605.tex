Sweetest love, I do not go\footnotetext{Very Reverend Dr John Donne (1572 -- 1631). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin For weariness of thee,\\
Nor in hope the world can show\\
\vin A fitter love for me;\\
\vin \vin But since that I\\
Must die at last, 'tis best\\
To use myself in jest\\*
\vin \vin Thus by feigned deaths to die.\\!

Yesternight the sun went hence,\\*
\vin And yet is here today;\\
He hath no desire nor sense,\\
\vin Nor \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} so short a way:\\
\vin \vin Then fear not me,\\
But believe that I shall make\\
Speedier journeys, since I take\\*
\vin \vin More wings \& spurs than he.\\!

O how feeble is man's power,\\*
\vin That if good fortune fall\\
Cannot add another hour,\\
\vin Nor a lost hour recall!\\
\vin \vin But come bad chance,\\
And we join to'it our strength,\\
And we teach it art \& length,\\*
\vin \vin Itself o'er us t'advance.\\!

When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not wind,\\*
\vin But sigh'st my soul away;\\
When thou weep'st, unkindly kind,\\
\vin My life's blood doth decay.\\
\vin \vin It cannot be\\
That thou lov'st me, as thou say'st,\\
If in thine my life thou waste,\\*
\vin \vin That art the best of me.\\!

Let not thy divining heart\\*
\vin Forethink me any ill;\\
Destiny may take thy part,\\
\vin And may thy fears fulfil;\\
\vin \vin But think that we\\
Are but turned aside to sleep;\\
They who one another keep\\*
\vin \vin Alive, ne'er parted be.
