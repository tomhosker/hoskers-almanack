\poemlines{5}
Carry her over the water,\footnotetext{Prof Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
\vin And set her down under a tree,\\
Where the culvers white all day \& all night\\
\vin And the winds from every \sfrac{1}{4}\\*
Sing agreeably, agreeably, agreeably of love.\\!

Put a gold ring on her finger\\*
\vin And press her close to your heart,\\
While the fish in the lake their snapshots take,\\
\vin And the frog, that sanguine singer,\\*
Sings agreeably, agreeably, agreeably of love.\\!

The streets shall flock to your marriage,\\*
\vin The houses turn round to look,\\
The tables \& chairs say suitable prayers,\\
\vin And the horses drawing your carriage\\*
Sing agreeably, agreeably, agreeably of love.
\end{verse}
