Lying asleep between the strokes of night,\footnotetext{`Love and Sleep', Algernon Swinburne (1837 -- 1909). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
\vin I saw my love lean over my sad bed,\\
\vin Pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head,\\
Smooth-skinned \& dark, with bare throat made to bite,\\
Too wan for blushing \& too warm for white,\\
\vin But perfect-coloured without white or red.\\
\vin And her lips opened amorously, and said\\
I wist not what, saving one word: `Delight.'\\
And all her face was honey to my mouth,\\
\vin And all her body pasture to mine eyes;\\
\vin \vin The long lithe arms \& hotter hands than fire,\\
The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south,\\
\vin The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs\\*
\vin \vin And glittering eyelids of my soul's desire.
\end{verse}
