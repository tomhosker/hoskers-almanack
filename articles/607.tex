\poemlines{5}
The grey sea \& the long black land;\footnotetext{`Meeting at Night', Robert Browning (1812 -- 1889). \cite{newlove}.}\\*
And the yellow \sfrac{$1$}{$2$}-moon large \& low;\\
And the startled little waves that leap\\
In fiery ringlets from their sleep,\\
As I gain the cove with pushing prow,\\*
And quench its speed i' the slushy sand.\\!

Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;\\*
Three fields to cross till a farm appears;\\
A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch\\
And blue spurt of a lighted match,\\
And a voice less loud, through its joys \& fears,\\*
Than the two hearts beating each to each.
\end{verse}
