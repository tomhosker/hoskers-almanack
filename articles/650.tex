Can I not come to thee, my God, for these\footnotetext{$\xi$ `To his ever-loving God', Rev Robert Herrick (1591 -- 1674). \cite{obev}.}\\*
So very-many-meeting hindrances,\\
That slack my pace, but yet not make me stay?\\
Who slowly goes, rids, in the end, his way.\\
Clear thou my paths, or shorten thou my miles;\\
Remove the bars, or lift me o'er the stiles;\\
Since rough the way is, help me when I call,\\
And take me up; or else prevent the fall.\\
I ken my home, and it affords some ease\\
To see far off the smoking villages.\\
Fain would I rest, yet covet not to die\\
For fear of future biting penury:\\
No, no, my God -- thou know'st my wishes be\\*
To leave this life not loving it, but thee.
