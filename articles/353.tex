\begin{verse}
\poemlines{5}
The Spirit of the Lord {\hge GOD} is upon me; because the {\hge LORD} hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\footnotetext{Isaiah 61.1-4. \cite{kjv}.}\\
To proclaim the acceptable year of the {\hge LORD}, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;\\
To appoint unto them that mourn in {\hge Zion}, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the {\hge LORD}, that he might be glorified.\\
And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
