The ogre does what ogres can,\footnotetext{`August 1968', Prof. Wystan Auden (1907 -- 1973). \cite{audena}.}\\*
Deeds quite impossible for man,\\
But one prize is beyond his reach;\\
The ogre cannot master speech.\\
About a subjugated plain,\\
Among its desperate \& slain,\\
The ogre stands with hands on hips,\\*
While drivel gushes from his lips.
