\poemlines{5}
As I was a-walking one midsummer's morning\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{rusby_tgwcf}.}\\*
\vin To hear the birds whistle and the nightingales play.\\
'Twas there that I met a beautiful maiden\\*
\vin As I was a-walking all on the highway.\\!

`Where are you going, my fair pretty lady?\\*
\vin Where are you going so early this morn?'\\
She answered, `Kind sir, to visit my neighbours;\\*
\vin I'm going down to {\sc Lincoln}, the place I was born.'\\!

`May I go with you, my fair pretty lady?\\*
\vin May I go along in your sweet company?'\\
She turned her head round and, smiling all at me,\\*
\vin Said: `You may come with me, kind sir, if you please.'\\!

We hadn't been walking a few miles together\\*
\vin Before this young damsel began to show free.\\
She sat herself down, saying, `Sit down beside me.\\*
\vin The games we shall play will be one, two \& three.'\\!

I said, `My dear lady, if you're fond of the gaming,\\*
\vin There's one game I know I would like you to learn.\\
The game it is called ``The Game of All Fours''.'\\*
\vin So I took out my pack and began the first turn.\\!

She cut the cards and I fell a-dealing.\\*
\vin I dealt her a trump and myself the poor jack.\\
She led off her ace and stole my jack from me,\\*
\vin Saying, `Jack is the card I like best in your pack.'\\!

`I dealt them last time: it's your turn to shuffle,\\*
\vin My turn to show the best card in the pack.'\\
Once more she'd the ace \& deuce for to beat me;\\*
\vin Once again I had lost when I laid down poor jack.\\!

So I took up my hat and I bid her good morning.\\*
\vin I said, `You're the best that I know at this game.'\\
She answered, `Young man, if you'll come back tomorrow,\\*
\vin We'll play the game over \& over again.'
