A flower was offered to me,\footnotetext{`My Pretty Rose Tree', William Blake (1757 -- 1827). \cite{blakea}.}\\*
\vin Such a flower as may never bore.\\
But I said I've a pretty rose tree,\\*
\vin And I passed the sweet flower o'er.\\!

Then I went to my pretty rose tree,\\*
\vin To tend her by day and by night.\\
But my rose turned away with jealousy,\\*
\vin And her thorns were my only delight.
