\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{5}
Come all brother tradesmen that travel along:\footnotetext{Anon. \cite{aamhat}.}\\*
O pray come and tell me where the trade is all gone.\\*
Long time have I travelled and I cannot find none.\\!

{\it And sing O the hard times of old England!\\*
In old England very hard times!\\!}

Provisions you buy at the shop it is true\\*
But if you've no money there's none there for you.\\*
So what's a poor man and his family to do?\\!

You must go to the shop and you'll ask for a job.\\*
They'll answer you there with a shake and a nod.\\*
Well that's enough to make a man turn out and rob.\\!

You will see the poor tradesmen a-walking the street\\*
From morning till night for employment to seek,\\*
And scarce have they got any shoes on their feet\\!

Our soldiers \& sailors have just come from war,\\*
Been fighting for Queen \& country this year,\\*
Come home to be starved: better stayed where they were.\\!

And now to conclude and to finish my song:\\*
Let us hope that these hard times they will not last long.\\*
I hope soon to have occasion to alter my song.\\!

{\it And sing O the good times of old England!\\*
In old England jolly good times!\\!}
