I wandered lonely as a cloud\footnotetext{Dr William Wordsworth (1770 -- 1850). \cite{norton}.}\\* 
\vin That floats on high o'er vales \& hills,\\
When all at once I saw a crowd,\\
\vin A host, of golden daffodils;\\
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\\*
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.\\!

Continuous as the stars that shine\\*
\vin And twinkle on the milky way,\\
They stretched in never-ending line\\
\vin Along the margin of a bay:\\
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,\\*
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.\\!

The waves beside them danced; but they\\*
\vin Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:\\
A poet could not but be gay,\\
\vin In such a jocund company:\\
I gazed \& gazed, but little thought\\*
What wealth the show to me had brought:\\!

For oft, when on my couch I lie\\*
\vin In vacant or in pensive mood,\\
They flash upon that inward eye\\
\vin Which is the bliss of solitude;\\
And then my heart with pleasure fills,\\*
And dances with the daffodils.
