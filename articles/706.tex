With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,\footnotetext{`For the Fallen', Prof Laurence Binyon (1869 -- 1943). \cite{oxfordlarkin}.}\\*
\vin England mourns for her dead across the sea.\\
Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,\\*
\vin Fallen in the cause of the free.\\!

Solemn the drums thrill; death august \& royal\\*
\vin Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres,\\
There is music in the midst of desolation\\*
\vin And a glory that shines upon our tears.\\!

They went with songs to the battle; they were young,\\*
\vin Straight of limb, true of eye, steady \& aglow.\\
They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;\\*
\vin They fell with their faces to the foe.\\!

They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\\*
\vin Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\\
At the going down of the sun \& in the morning\\*
\vin We will remember them.\\!

They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;\\*
\vin They sit no more at familiar tables of home;\\
They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;\\*
\vin They sleep beyond England's foam.\\!

But where our desires are \& our hopes profound,\\*
\vin Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,\\
To the innermost heart of their own land they are known\\*
\vin As the stars are known to the night;\\!

As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,\\*
\vin Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;\\
As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,\\*
\vin To the end, to the end, they remain.
