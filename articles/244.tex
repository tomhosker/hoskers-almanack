My head, my heart, mine eyes, my life, nay more,\footnotetext{`A Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment', Mrs Anne Bradstreet (?1612 -- 1672). \cite{norton}. \P The Ipswich in question would seem to be the one in Massachusetts, and not the one in England. \P The word \emph{sol} is Latin for \emph{sun}.}\\* 
My joy, my magazine of earthly store,\\ 
If two be one, as surely thou and I,\\
How stayest thou there, whilst I at {\sc Ipswich} lie?\\
So many steps, head from the heart to sever\\
If but a neck, soon should we be together:\\
I like the earth this season, mourn in black,\\
My sun is gone so far in 's zodiack,\\
Whom whilst I 'joyed, nor storms, nor frosts I felt,\\
His warmth such frigid colds did cause to melt.\\
My chill\`ed limbs now numb\`ed lie forlorn;\\
Return, return sweet {\hge sol} from Capricorn;\\
In this dead time, alas, what can I more\\
Then view those fruits which through thy heat I bore,\\
Which sweet contentment yield me for a space,\\
True living pictures of their father's face?\\
O strange effect! now thou art southward gone,\\
I weary grow, the tedious day so long;\\
But when thou northward to me shalt return,\\ 
I wish my sun may never set, but burn\\
Within the Cancer of my glowing breast,\\
The welcome house of him my dearest guest.\\
Where ever, ever stay, and go not thence,\\
Till natures sad decree shall call thee hence;\\
Flesh of thy flesh, bone of thy bone,\\*
I here, thou there, yet both but one.
